Automotive,"Fits well on my Subaru Crosstrek.  My only gripe is that it's hard to find a place in the back seat, so I don't have much room for it. I've owned several Crosstrek sedans before and this one has been great.",GUIDED
Electronics,"If you are looking for a sound system that is easy to set up, this may not be the case.  You will need an external power supply or something like that. I have tried other similar products and they seem to work just fine.",NON-GUIDED
Health & Personal Care,"This set is great for those looking to get a lot out of the box.  It doesn't have all the bells and whistles, but it's still very functional.",GUIDED
Outdoors,"Generally speaking, this product is made in the USA.  It has a lot of features that make it easy to open and close doors without damaging your safety. There are many different types of door locks for each type of door lock.  For example: 1) The key chain on the inside of the box can be opened with either one or two small keys (or both).  This allows you to easily access the outside of the box by simply holding down the &#34;fingerprint&#34; button while opening/close. 2) You can also use the “slip-down” switch which opens the door slightly above the top of the box if you don't want to do so.  In other words, there is no locking feature at all.",NON-GUIDED
Toys,I do not want to waste my money on this product.  I am happy with the quality of the packaging and delivery.,GUIDED
Books,Arrived when it was time to write a book. I do not recommend this product.  I am very disappointed in the quality of the books and their content.,GUIDED
Outdoors,"Got this for my son and he loves it.  It is easy to put together, folds up easily with no effort at all.  The only thing I don't like about the handle is that you have to be careful not to screw in your key chain when opening or closing.",NON-GUIDED
Shoes,I knew I would order these shoes but they were too small for me.,GUIDED
Furniture,"The frame is strong and easy to assemble.  The only thing I would have liked was that there were a few small holes in the back of the frame, but they didn't make it into the box.",GUIDED
PC,Attended my daughter for a very long time and she loves it.  She is 5'9&#34; and weighs 250 pounds.,NON-GUIDED

Video Games,this is a great video game.  The graphics are nice and the story is very interesting.  I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys fighting games.,GUIDED
Tools,"At first I thought this would be a bit of a novelty, but after reading the reviews it turned out to be.  It is well made and easy to use. The only thing that annoys me is how long it takes to set up an internet connection.  You just have to hook up your router in order to do so.  If you don't want to go through all those hoops then there are no instructions on how to set up an internet connection... I've tried several different types of internet connections before: 1) Internet Explorer 8 (version 9), Chrome OS 7 (version 10), Netgear T-Mobile Uverse (version 11), Verizon FiOS 4G LTE (version 12).  The Opera browser has some great features such as support for downloading videos from Netflix or other video services without having to worry about re-downloading them.",NON-GUIDED
Pet Products,I was very pleased with this product.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good quality dog food.,GUIDED

Apparel,This was a gift for my husband and he loves it.  He has been wearing it since the age of 10 so we decided to give it a try.,NON-GUIDED

Wireless,My senior mother broke off of this wireless mouse when she was a little girl.  She has been using it for about 2 months now and I have not had any issues.,GUIDED
Camera,"Battery worked good for about a week.  The only thing I noticed was that the battery stopped working after just a few days of use.  So if you have an older phone, it will be fine too.",GUIDED
Sports,"Recently purchased a pair of these shoes.  They fit great and are very comfortable.  I wear them every day for about 3-4 hours each day to work out on my next project. I have bought several pairs in the past but they will not last me much longer than 2 weeks, so this one is no exception.  If you are looking for an easy way to keep your feet warm while running or swimming, these may be the shoe for you! The only reason I am giving 5 stars is that it does not come with a &#34;Shoes&#34; cap.  However, if you are looking for an easy way to keep your feet warm while running or swimming, these might be the shoe for you.",NON-GUIDED
Grocery,"Anytime.com is a great place to get the fresher and fresher products in your pantry.  I love that you can order them at any time, as long as you don't have to worry about dryness.",NON-GUIDED

Pet Products,"kitty loves it.  It's a little hard to put together, but I'm very happy with the quality of the product.",GUIDED
Apparel,"After a few weeks of wearing it, I decided to try something different.  This is my second purchase from this company and the first time I've worn it in less than two months. Pros<br />- Easy to set up<br />- It's easy to set up<br />- Doesn't have too much room for your hands (and feet)<br />- Looks very nice on my wrist!<br />- Does not look as dirty as some other brands like [[ASIN:B00F9YJQ8]]. So far so good...<br />Cons<br />- The straps are difficult to get around but they don't seem to bother you at all if you take them off with just one hand instead of three or four<br />- You can adjust the strap height by changing the length of the strap - that would make it slightly easier to reach down.",NON-GUIDED
Grocery,Recently purchased this book.  It is a must read for anyone wanting to learn more about the history of man and his time. I would highly recommend this book if you are interested in learning more about the lives of men and women around the world during the Civil War.,NON-GUIDED
Video DVD,Excellent Concert....wish I could listen to more of this.,GUIDED
Watches,"Just what I was looking for.  This watch is made in China and looks like a real sapphire crystal.  It has a lot of features to it that make it easy to understand the finer points. The only thing i don't like about this watch is its design.  The face is very simple to read, so you have to figure out how to use it on your wrist.",NON-GUIDED
Luggage,"Not sure if this is a good product or not, but it's great.  I am very happy with the quality and color of the luggage.",NON-GUIDED
Tools,"This little gem is a great tool for everyday use.  I've used it many times over and have been very impressed with the quality of the product.  It's not difficult to find &#34;tools&#34; on Amazon, but you can't beat the price.",GUIDED
Sports,I'm not sure if this product is worth the money.,NON-GUIDED
Outdoors,Just what I was looking for.  This is a very well made product.  It has plenty of room in the back so you don't have to worry about it falling off or anything like that.  The only thing i had to do was put some tape on this one and make sure not to get too wet.,NON-GUIDED
Jewelry,"Very Pretty, Just what I was looking for.  The face is very pretty and the neck is a bit loose which makes it difficult to see from the outside.",GUIDED
PC,"Often times I have to go through a lot of hoops to get this item up and running.  This is the only one that works well for me. Pros:<br />-It's easy to set up, but it takes some getting used to...<br />-You don't have to worry about plugging in &#34;to&#34; so you can do everything.<br />-The included cables are pretty straight forward (I've had no problems with them)<br />-Cons:<br />-Unplugged cable doesn't seem to help much at all when plugged in<br />-Battery life seems to be very low compared to other USB 3.0 chargers out there.<br />-There aren't any external power connectors available on this device!<br />-Wireless charging isn't as good as my old battery powered ones.",NON-GUIDED
Kitchen,You can absolutely believe that this is made in China.  I live in the U.S.,GUIDED
Toys,I bought it as a gift for my daughter and she loves it.,GUIDED
Grocery,I purchased this for my husband and he loves it.  It is a good product but not worth the money.  I would definitely buy again.,GUIDED
Jewelry,"The jeweler loves it.  I bought two of these for my husband as a gift, and he loved them too.  They are very easy to set up (he has not used any tools yet), and they work well on his silver plating board.  He also likes the fact that there is plenty of room in the back where you can put more pieces of jewelry if needed.",NON-GUIDED
Automotive,"Rude, this is a great product.  I have had it for about 3 months now and am very pleased with the quality of the car.  It's easy to set up (once you turn it on/off) and has all the bells and whistles that my other electrician uses.",NON-GUIDED
Tools,I use them all the time.  They are very durable and easy to use.,GUIDED

Electronics,they made the solar panels work like a dream.  They are easy to install and I'm very happy with them.,GUIDED

Sports,"Bought two of these for my wife and I love them!  They are very well made, easy to set up, great price.  Would buy again if they were a little larger than the size listed.",GUIDED
PC,"This is my first gaming pc. I have been using it for over a year now and the sound quality is outstanding. It does not seem to interfere with games, but if you are looking for an inexpensive piece of equipment that will enhance your gaming experience, this may be the PC for you.",GUIDED
Luggage,Not my first time using this.  I have used it for a couple of days and no problems.  It is very comfortable to carry with me all the time.,GUIDED
Books,a dog tells what to look for and how to do it.<br />This book is a must read for anyone interested in learning more about dogs.,GUIDED

Musical Instruments,"I've been using these for over a year now.  They are easy to set up, and the price is right.",NON-GUIDED
Home Entertainment,"Ok, I have to say that this is a good product.  It does what it's supposed to do and doesn't take up much room in the living room.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the low price. Pros:<br />- Easy set up<br />- Simple setup<br />- Remote control<br />- Bluetooth<br />- Wi-Fi<br />- Fast charging<br />- Support for Roku<br />- Online streaming<br />- Sound bar<br />- You can stream music directly from your computer via bluetooth without having to worry about plugging in any additional devices (iPad, iPod touch, etc)<br />Cons:<br />- Battery life seems to be very high compared to other Sony products so if you are running an older or overpowered home entertainment system then this may not be the case...",NON-GUIDED
Health & Personal Care,My husband and I have been using this product for many years.  It is the most effective way to help him feel better after a long period of use.,NON-GUIDED
Books,"Before I started this review, I wanted to give you a bit of background.  This is the first book I've read that deals with religious beliefs and how they can affect your decision making. There are many books out there that deal with some of the most important issues facing us today - whether we believe in God or not.  For example, St.",NON-GUIDED

PC,I've been using this for about a month now and it works great.  I'm very happy with the quality of the product as far as performance is concerned.,NON-GUIDED
Sports,"Went in great condition. I love the fact that it comes with a power cord, so if you're looking for something to plug your TV into, this is what you need. It's very easy to set up and operate without having to do anything else. My only complaint is that there isn't any built-in audio capability at all. The speakers themselves aren't as loud as some of the other speaker manufacturers out there have.",NON-GUIDED
Wireless,"Often times I have to use a power strip at the end of my cable.  This is great because it allows you to charge your phone faster than any other wireless device out there. It's not as big or bulky as some others, but if you are looking for something that can be charged quickly and easily, this may be the answer.",NON-GUIDED
Musical Instruments,"I am an amateur drummer.  I have a lot of guitars, but these are very good for the money.  The only thing that surprised me was how easy they were to set up.",GUIDED
Lawn and Garden,"Goes together very well.  I love the fact that it is so easy to put together.  It does take some getting used to, but if you are looking for a quick way to do just that, this is one of them.",GUIDED
Home Improvement,"I was skeptical about this product, but it works great.  It's easy to install and use.",GUIDED
Electronics,I had problems connecting to my computer.  I do not have an internet connection but it is a good idea to set up your own wireless router.,GUIDED
Musical Instruments,Beautiful sound.  I'm very pleased with this product and would recommend to anyone looking for a guitar that can play classical music.,NON-GUIDED
Kitchen,"Firstly, let me start by saying that I am not a big fan of the French style coffee maker.  This one is made in France and has been around for many years.  However, after trying to make my way through the U.S., I decided to try something different.  There are so many things you can't do with this machine: 1. It takes less than an hour to assemble. 2. You have to be very careful when it comes to making your morning coffee. 3. If you don't want to use any kind of heat source (e.g. hot-brewed coffee), this will probably only take about 5 minutes depending on where you set it. 4. The instructions aren't easy to follow even if you know what you're doing.",NON-GUIDED
Wireless,"It's a little pricey, but you can get it for less than what you pay.  I bought this to replace my old wireless router that had an ethernet cable and was able to hook up the internet without any issues. Pros<br />- Easy to set up<br />- Relay/Netflix<br />Cons<br />- Wasn't very happy with the quality of the interface (other than that one)<br />- It took me about 10 minutes to figure out how to use it on my home network so long as there were no problems. Cons<br />- You have to be careful when setting up your Internet connection if you don't want to go into all the trouble of switching between different devices or services.",NON-GUIDED

Camera,"I was looking for a camera that could capture all kinds of insects and plants.  This is the first camera I have used in over a year. It took me about an hour to get it up and running, but after several hours my phone started vibrating loudly from time to time.",GUIDED
Toys,Poorly made.,GUIDED
Sports,"These are great for the price.  The quality is good, but I'm not sure if it's because they don't fit well in my pocket or something like that.",GUIDED
Musical Instruments,"I'd like to say that this is a very good instrument for beginners.  I've been using it all the time and have never had any problems. It's got some really nice sounding strings, but you can't really use them as much as they are in my opinion.  The bass isn't great at all (as far as tuning).  It's not super loud or high-pitched - just so you know what?  In other words, if you don't want to listen to music from an acoustic standpoint, try these! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the lack of clarity on the string itself.  That being said, there aren't too many instruments out there that make such a huge amount of noise.",NON-GUIDED
Lawn and Garden,"I've had this for about a year now.  It's so much easier to put together than I imagined it would be.  The colors are great, the wood is very pretty (it's not mahogany like some of my neighbors think).  My only complaint is that there aren't any instructions on how to set up or even what to do. First off, let me start with the first thing you need to know:<br />1. You have to go into the main room in order to get access to the garage door.  If you don't want to enter the garage door, then just open the front door and close the door.  There should be no opening at all between the two doors.  This will allow you to use both sides as long as you're willing to compromise your entry/outdoor access. 2.",NON-GUIDED

Outdoors,"Sadly, the snowfall this year was so bad that I decided to give it a try.  It's hard to get rid of the holes in the front and back sides when you can't open them or close them at all.  The only thing I didn't like was how long it would last for me.",GUIDED
Camera,"Used this for my Nikon D3-D and it works great.  I have no complaints about the camera, but once you get used to it is definitely worth every penny.",NON-GUIDED
Grocery,"They work great.  I am not a big fan of garlic, but this is the best thing to have in your pantry.",NON-GUIDED
Home Improvement,Attended this product well.  It is easy to install and has a lot of room for all kinds of items.  The only complaint I have is that the screws are not centered properly so you can't really see them. I would recommend this product as it allows you to adjust the amount of space in your home improvement unit by adjusting the height of the screws rather than simply adding or removing the screws when necessary.,NON-GUIDED
Automotive,"The Heininger 3059 is one of the best motorcycles I've ever owned.  It has a very good feel to it, and you can't beat the price.",GUIDED
Musical Instruments,Excellent value.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a guitar that can be played without any problems.,NON-GUIDED
Wireless,"While this is a good product, it does not have any problems.  You will need to hook up your cell phone in order to access the wireless network. If you are looking for an easy way to get around the monthly fees charged by Verizon or AT&T, I would recommend this device.  If you are looking for something that can be used as a WiFi hotspot (for example Wi-Fi only) and don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on anything else, then this one is definitely there.",NON-GUIDED

Automotive,"Anyhow, this is a great car.  It's easy to set up and operate without having to worry about the batteries falling off. The only complaint I have with it is that you can't adjust the height of the steering wheel if your hands are too far away from the steering wheel.  This may not be an issue for me as my hands tend to move around much more than most other types of vehicles.  However, there are plenty of options available on this very wide variety of wheels.  For example, let's say we're going to drive our Honda CRV at 65 mph (62 kph).  Let's say we want to drive our Honda CRV at 85 mph (62 kph).  Then let's say we need to turn left or right depending on how long the speed range is.",NON-GUIDED

Toys,"Avoiding Toys&#34; are a lot of toys that don't have the bells and whistles.  This toy is made in China, so it's not something you're going to be able to buy from anywhere else.  The only thing I liked about this toy was how easy it can be to put together.  There were no instructions on how to assemble or even how to install.",NON-GUIDED

Baby,"My 3 year old loves these.  They are easy to put together and look like they will last a long time. I also love the fact that they can be hung up in an upright position so you don't have to worry about them falling off of your bed.  I'm not sure if it's because my 4 year old doesn't want to fall asleep on her bed, but she just wants to sleep with her mom! The only complaint I have is that there isn't enough room for one side or part of the base to hold all the baby stuff (like diapers).  That being said, we're still trying to figure out how to place our little pajama pieces into each other's cribs as well.  It took me awhile to figure this out...but then again, nothing has been figured out yet.",NON-GUIDED

You don't have to go out and buy clothes or anything that will make you happy.  It's pretty much all there is to enjoy! The graphics are really good too.  The only complaint I have is it doesn't look very realistic at all.  That being said, if you can't play as many video games as you want, then odds are you won't be able to watch any of these games.  If you can't figure out how to do that, then what else can you do?  For example, playing Mario Kart 8 on Wii U isn't possible without having some sort of glitchy sound effect for your ears.",NON-GUIDED

It has held up very well with no damage from any type of malnourished person in my life. My only complaint is that if you are not careful enough to use your hand or fingers to cut through an entire piece of wood (or anything like that).

It's pretty much identical to Call of Duty or Mass Effect 3 (although they're both quite different).  However, once you get the hang of the fact that these two games aren't completely separate from each other, things start to get really interesting.  The gameplay itself doesn't make your head spin around trying to figure out how to play multiplayer without actually doing so.  You just have to sit back and think through the entire thing before you can even try to figure out how to play multiplayer without actually doing so.",NON-GUIDED

For example: 1) You will be able to choose from 3 outfits depending on which one suits you best (i.e., if you wear an orange/blue suit).  4) If you do not want to play as many outfits as possible, go ahead and buy 2 outfits for each outfit. 5) The costume options are pretty limited compared to other video games such as Battlefield, World of Tanks, Need for Speed 5, Metal Gear Solid V, Plants vs. Zombies, etc.  However, there are plenty of customization options available throughout the game.",NON-GUIDED

The gameplay is pretty straight forward, and there are tons of options available for you to choose from.  You can customize your character based on how well you like or dislike certain aspects of the game (e.g., fighting), etc.. You'll be able to change outfits in different ways depending on where you're going with these outfits.  For example, if you play as a ninja, you might want to go with a black kukui shirt rather than a white kukui shirt.  This would allow you to create custom outfits without having to worry about re-creating them yourself.  If you don't have any desire to do so, then this may not work for you...",NON-GUIDED

You will be able to put your laptop on top without taking up too much space or anything like that. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was due to the length of the strap itself.  That being said, if you don't have an exact grasp on how to hold it, then there may be some confusion as to why someone doesn't know exactly how to open it.  For example, my husband has his iPad Air 2 so he won't even take it out when we first opened it.",NON-GUIDED

You'll end up with more trouble than you bargained for!  The easiest way to get started is by practicing &#34;Cocaine Blues&#34; (or B-sidekicks).

I love how small these boots are compared to other high end slacks that cost around $40-$100.

You'll never find anything more than 1/4 inch in your hand.  That being said, if you've ever used something with less than 1/4 inch of steel (or maybe even 2/3&#34; or 3/8&#34;) then you won't want to spend thousands of dollars trying to fix it yourself.

It took me about an hour to get used to taking pictures since I'm only able to take 2 photos per day. The biggest plus is that you can still see all the different modes on the LCD display so you don't have to worry about getting lost or fainting any time soon!

You will be amazed at how well it accomplishes its goals without resorting too far into self-delegation.  It's not just an exercise in futility; it's also a learning experience as well.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because there were so many negative reviews about the book: * * * *The author/writer (whom I've never met) had his entire life derailed due to lack of access to any kind of secure e-book store. * * *It wasn't until recently that I finally started using Amazon's ""GOOG"" cloud storage service.",NON-GUIDED

If you're looking for an action/adventure game with lots of replay value, here's my recommendation: 1) If you want something that will make your life so much easier (e.g., fighting games), then this is one of those games.  It has tons of replay value too.  You'll be amazed at how well each mechanic works in its own unique way.  For instance, if you have two or more enemies on the same path, they can go up and down stairs together without having to worry about getting hit by other enemies.",NON-GUIDED

PC,"Ok, I've been using this for a few years now.  It works great and the sound quality is very good.  The only thing i don't like about it is that you have to adjust the volume in order to make it work.

I've been using it on my wife's [[ASIN:B004ZPYJ8 TSA Check-In]].  I'm glad I did! The only thing I didn't like was that there were some pockets where you could easily fill them up with whatever you wanted.  That being said, if you don't want to have too many pockets at your door (which will probably be helpful when you're carrying large items) then these may not work well for you.  If you do need more pockets then these won't hold as much space as they are made out of.  You can fit two or three small purses full of cashmere mending buckwheat paper envelopes into each pocket.",NON-GUIDED

You just need to press the button several times before setting the shutter speed even.

I've used several different types of headphones for various purposes (e.g., audiophiles) but none were as immersive as these.  For example, if you're listening to music from an external speaker connected to your computer or earbuds, you'll be able to hear some sounds at certain points while others may not. Sound quality is very good; however, there are times when things aren't as clear as they seem.",NON-GUIDED

Books,"While this book is a bit short, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the writing. I have read many books in my life that are based on fairy tales and fairy tale characters.  The author has plenty of stories to go along with his or her story line; however, he tends to focus more on one character than the other.  While it may not seem like much for an adult reader (or any child) to spend hours reading through all the fairy-tale books, there's something wonderful about Little Red Riding Hood that really resonates with me. My favorite part of Little Red Riding Hood is how she manages to keep herself safe from getting caught up in these fairy-tale world situations.",NON-GUIDED

So if you are looking for something that will help keep your yard grass green, look no further! This product does exactly what it says it should do - make sure you follow the directions in order to get it set up correctly.

I've had no issues with my stovetop cooking or anything like that.  The only thing I didn't notice was how much water came out in the pan when I first opened it.  There were about 1/2 cups of water per cup (not too large).  You have to be careful not to over-spout any kind of liquid if you're going to use it.",NON-GUIDED

I am 6'3&#34; and weigh 145 lbs so I don't have to worry about losing weight at all.  The only thing that surprised me was how easy it is to put on your shoulder strap when you are not wearing it.  This allowed me to wear it without having to go through any physical exertion (exercising or stretching). It took me about an hour to get used to, but once I got used to it has held up quite well.  My biggest gripe with it is that if you do sit down while doing anything other than walking, there will be no amount of support from the waistband as opposed to being able to reach into the chest area.",NON-GUIDED
Watches,"After a few months of use I decided to give this watch a try.  It is very easy to set up and it looks great on my wrist.  My only complaint is that the strap does not stay closed so you have to pull out the strap just to put your finger in there.  If you are trying to change the strap, do not remove the strap if you don't want to.  The clasp itself doesn't come off easily but once you get used to it will work fine.",NON-GUIDED

Pros:<br />- It's easy to set up and take pictures without having to do anything else (such as manual shutter speed).<br />- You can zoom in or out of the camera at any time by just taking a few photos with your hands on one hand instead of using the other.

Video DVD,"First of all, I wanted to give this DVD a try.  It's not as good as the Blu-ray version that came with it.  The picture quality is very poor compared to what you would expect from an average DVD player. Pros:<br />1) You can't really see or hear any sound in the background and 2) There are so many different sounds throughout the entire movie (e.g. music, etc.)<br />3) This little booklet lets you figure out how to use your surround sound speakers when you need them!<br />4) If you're looking for a better way to record movies on blu-ray, this may be the one place you'll want to learn more about those techniques.

Electronics,"Have had this for a couple of years now and love it.  I have to say, the sound is great!  It's easy to set up and play music without having to plug in an external outlet.  The only thing i didn't like was that there wasn't a power supply on the unit so you would have to make sure your wires were connected correctly.  There are no instructions on how to turn it on or off but if you want to use some kind of remote control (e.g. bluetooth) then just go to Settings > Power &#34;Remote Control&#34; Connecting both devices also works very well. I highly recommend this product.",NON-GUIDED

Musical Instruments,"Anyways, this is a very nice sounding instrument.  I have not used any of the other instruments in my life and they seem to be well balanced.  However, it's worth noting that there are no built-in tuners on this device. There are also no built-in tuners for beginners or anyone who wants to learn how to use them.  The only way you can get these sounds is by looking at some of the online reviews which states exactly what kind of tuner you're going to use.  You'll need an internet connection to hook up your devices (via bluetooth). The biggest problem with this particular type of equipment is its limitations.  It doesn't play classical music quite as well as classical music.",NON-GUIDED

I have tried several different sizes to fit in my pajama pants (which are too large for me), but the one that came with them was wide enough so that they wouldn't fall out when you were trying to get your feet wet.  They didn't hold up very well at all - especially if you're wearing medium or high-pitched shorts! The other thing I would like to point out is that most people don't seem to care about sizing down their pajama pants due to how small they are. This isn't an issue because there aren't any pockets on the inside of the pants which make it difficult to open without putting pressure on the fabric lining.",NON-GUIDED

Luggage,"Generally speaking, this is a good bag.  It holds everything you need and I can carry it anywhere. It's wide enough to hold all of my stuff in one hand while carrying it.  There are plenty of pockets on either side for extra storage or as small as your luggage can fit without being too bulky.  The only thing that annoys me is the fact that there are so many zippered compartments inside each compartment which make it difficult to find items when not in use.",NON-GUIDED

It took me about 5 minutes to figure out what's going on with these buttons.  It took me about 20 minutes to figure out which ones worked best for me.

It has plenty of room for extra storage where we can store &#34;durable&#34; items such as pens, cell phone chargers, etc...<br />3.

Video Games,"I'd like to say that this game is very good.  I've played it a couple of times now, and the graphics are excellent.  The only complaint I have is that there isn't much in-game voice acting. The first few chapters were really hard for me to get through without having to do so.  However, after reading the previous chapters, I was able to figure out how to play them properly.  It's not something you would want to spend your money on unless you don't know how to use voice actors.  If you're just trying to keep playing games with people who aren't familiar with video games, then this might be an okay choice.",NON-GUIDED

Toys,"I'd like to say that this is a very well made toy.  It's heavy duty and looks nice in the picture. The only reason I gave it 5 stars was because of the lack of quality control.

Video DVD,"Check out this Blu-Ray player.  It does what it's supposed to do, and if you're looking for a better picture look no matter where you stand in the camera.

If you are experiencing any type of back pain from overuse (e.g., cystic fibrosis), then this may be good for you.  For instance, if you're having eczema/seizures in your joints, then this may help! 3) This has helped me get rid of some of my aches and pains while using it.

Electronics,"Don't buy this product unless you're a fan of electronics.  It's not as loud as I'd like it to be, but the sound is good enough for me. I've used many different types of electronic devices over the years and have never had any issues with them at all.  The most important thing about these things is that they don't interfere with your computer or whatever else you are doing.  You can get what you pay for by having them plugged into an external hard drive (i.e. USB 3.0) which in turn will allow you to charge more power than you would otherwise need.  That being said, if you want to use something less powerful then plugging those into an external hard drive doesn't necessarily make sense.",NON-GUIDED
Beauty,"Sometimes I get compliments on my work.  This is the first time I have tried using this product.  It has been a hit and miss for me in almost every aspect of my life. I use it all the time to make sure that my nails look like they are made from real wood. The only thing i don't like most about this product is how easy it is to set up.  If you're looking for an easy way to decorate your home or office, this may be the perfect solution.  The instructions aren't as straightforward as some other products out there... There are so many different ways to decorate your home or office without having to go through the whole process.  For example, if you want to decorate your home or office with sandals, this can be done by going through several steps before setting it up.",NON-GUIDED

They found that people with dementia had significantly lower levels of memory loss than non-dementia sufferers.",NON-GUIDED
Luggage,"I've had this bag for a few months now and it has held up great. The only thing I don't like about the zipper is that you have to be very careful when opening or closing the bag because there are so many zippered pockets on the inside of the bag. It's kind of hard to find in stores, but if you're looking for something more durable then this will definitely hold up.",NON-GUIDED

Grocery,"What's the difference between this and a regular bag? Pros:<br />- Easy to carry.<br />- Light weight.<br />- Plenty of space.  Cons:<br />- Larger than what you can find in your local grocery store.<br />- Doesn't hold up very well at all.<br />- Has lots of pockets for things like pens, cell phones, etc.<br />- Will last longer than some other bags I've owned.<br />- Does not look as expensive as others. Cons:<br />- The large size does make it hard to get out without putting too much or too much pressure on the zipper (which is annoying). I would recommend that you be careful when carrying items such as pencils/pencils if you don't want to put too much pressure on the zipper...",NON-GUIDED

Automotive,What a waste of time and money.,NON-GUIDED
Automotive,"First of all, I want to thank everyone who has given me this watch.  It is a great value for the money. I have been looking for a mechanical watch that will be easy to assemble and function without any problems.  The first thing I did was put an end to my frustration with the lack of time control (which in turn caused me to quit working).  This watch does exactly what it says it would do: 1. Holds 3-4 hours at a time so you can keep track of how long each hour is on your wrist.  If you are running late or having trouble remembering which one is going to charge, then there is no way to know which one is going to charge/wait for which one is going to charge... 2. Doesn't take up too much space as some other watches do but takes up less space than others.",NON-GUIDED

Luggage,"Good practical design, easy to carry and very durable.",GUIDED
Camera,"First time I bought this camera, it took me a while to figure out how to use the power button.  The first thing I did was turn on the shutter release switch and then there were no buttons for that purpose. The second thing I did was go into the settings menu (which is where you can select between cameras depending on which one you want).

Kitchen,"If you are looking for a quick and easy way to cook, this is the place to start.",NON-GUIDED
PC,"Anyhow, this is a great product.  I have had it for about 3 months now and am very happy with the quality of the product.  It does not take up too much space in my computer case but you can easily get rid of that by turning off the power on your PC.  The only complaint I have is that there is no way to turn off the power on any other outlet at all.  If you are using an outlet or if you want to use some kind of plug-n-play device (e.g. USB 2.0) then this will be fine.",NON-GUIDED

Toys,I'm very happy with this purchase.  It is easy to assemble and the quality is great.  My only complaint is that there are a few small areas where you have to be careful not to over tighten the screws so they don't get stuck in any of the holes.  I will definitely buy another one for my daughter.,NON-GUIDED
Luggage,"We bought this as a gift for our daughter and she loves it.  It was very easy to put together, but I had to do some extra work in order to get the luggage out of the suitcase.  She also loved being able to walk around with her hands free while we were doing laundry.  We have two children who are 7 months old and 5 years old.  The only problem is that they don't seem to care much about their luggage when we leave home.  When we arrive on time, there will be no air bags or any sort of compartments at all.  So far so good.",NON-GUIDED

Apparel,Very nice added bonus.,GUIDED
Jewelry,WOW! Great value for the money.,GUIDED

The second approach involved paying attention to what's actually going on behind the scenes.  There are lots of smart phones, tablets, TVs, iPods, cellophones, etc. There are plenty of devices that can be programmed to recognize certain things (e.g., music, movies, etc.) but not just those with very little knowledge of how to program them.

It has a lot of bells and whistles but the sound is not overpowering at all.

That being said, if you're going to spend more on electronics then look no further.  If you can afford one-time purchases with good quality audio (i.e. high end) then go ahead and buy what you need.

There are so many good games out there that I don't want to spend a lot of time on just one thing at a time.  For example, Call of Duty: Black Ops II was my favorite video game back in the day! The only reason I didn't get an XBOX One (or PS3) is because they have all the bells and whistles from Call of Duty: Black Ops III being included as extras.  That said, if you're looking for something more serious or engaging than Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, look no further.  If you're looking for something more action-packed, well worth the money, then this might be your first choice.",NON-GUIDED

The only complaint I have is that the cymbal isn't as smooth as some of the other pedals I've used.  The knobs are not sharp enough so they don't stick too far out of the way of your ears.  You can adjust them on their own but you'll need to take care of them first before you get rid of them.",NON-GUIDED

You can go back and put everything together in minutes or by just putting some tape on top of each other so that they don't spill over into the ground.  It works great as long as you know how to get rid of those messes if you want to keep things simple.

She also said she would buy another one from Amazon but could not find an exact replacement.",NON-GUIDED

I have had no problems installing the software on my new MacBook Pro or any other piece of equipment at all.  The only thing that kept me from doing was trying to unplug it after just a couple of minutes (not so long as I am using an external power source).  This allowed me to take some time to figure out how to plug it back in without having to do anything else.  There are many different ways you can choose which way will work for you; 1) You'll want to turn off the power supply if your computer does not support USB 3.0 instead of standard USB 2.0.  If you're running Windows XP SP3/Vista 7, then you might want to upgrade to OS X 10.1.",NON-GUIDED
Furniture,"Generally speaking, this is a very good piece of furniture.  It's made in the USA and it has held up well over the years.  The only thing I would like to point out is that if you are looking for an inexpensive way to put your furniture together, look no further. If you're looking for something more modern with lots of storage options, this may not be the case.  There are plenty of different types of shelving options available at various retail stores around the world.  You can even get what you pay for by using these instead of having to buy another set of drawers (which costs less than $10). I'd also like to point out that there are several ""furniture-grade"" shelving options available here on Amazon as well.  If you're looking for someone who will take care of all those things, then this might be the one.",NON-GUIDED

Pros: 1) There's so much more going on in this game than you could have imagined! You can't go wrong with some of the best action/adventure games out there at such a low price (like Mass Effect 3 or Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 4). 2) It's hard to get anything close to what you would expect from an action/adventure game. A lot of people don't realize how difficult it is for them to figure out how to solve puzzles without actually accomplishing those tasks.

Pet Products,"Apart from this product, I am a huge fan of Pet Products. They are easy to use and have great customer support. My only complaint is that when it comes to pet products they do not come up with the right amount of soap or conditioner.

It does not take up much space, but you can easily fit your phone in there without being too bulky.  You will be able to adjust the angle of the screen by just adjusting the center or right side of the screen depending on which one you are going to sit on.

The first thing I would say is that if you are dealing with animals, it is important to remember that there is no such thing as ""human nature"" (God).  If you are dealing with any kind of supernatural being, then what do you really want to hear?  In other words, when dealing with animals, let me start by saying that we have all kinds of psychic abilities - spirits, demons, etc. 2.",NON-GUIDED

The only thing I didn't like was that there were no instructions on how to activate the batteries (other than that). There are so many different ways to charge these things: 1) You can take them out of the receptacle with your hand or put them in the back of the case where they don't need to be touched. 2) If you want to use some kind of electric powered screwdriver instead of having to go through the whole lot of hard-to-find electrical wires then this will work just fine. 3) There is not much else to say about what goes into the box.",NON-GUIDED

You can easily get what you pay for by going into the seller's instructions on how to assemble them.  This isn't an issue with Jewelry stores but rather has been a problem for me over the years.

However, once you figure out how to play video games (or other genres) then my experience with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 has been quite different.  It's more about strategy vs. strategy versus.  You get what you pay for... The gameplay is pretty similar to those of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 but there aren't any major differences between the two titles.

He likes to take pictures with his phone while on vacation (he doesn't want to get caught up in an argument) so it won't distract him from anything else.

The only thing i didn't like was how long it took me to unplug the power cord from the SD card.  It took me about an hour to unplug the power cord as well so that would take some getting used to.

If you're looking for something more casual/dressy then this would be perfect.  However, it's not as big of a deal in my opinion.  It's actually bigger than most other shirts I've purchased.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is due to the price.  My biggest gripe here is how difficult it is to set up.

The battery seems to last quite a while but then its still there The batteries seem to last quite a bit longer than most other rechargeable batteries we've had in the past.  That being said, even after two years of use (with no complaints), nothing changed.  Battery life hasn't improved much since using it.

However, there are many things you can do to improve your odds of success. 1. Clean up<br />2. Make sure you clean it thoroughly before using it.  You will not be able to use it with gloves or anything else besides that. 3. Don't put too much pressure on the air freshener if you want to get rid of old junk.  The air freshener does take some getting used to but never quite fully submerge itself into the air.

Jewelry,"Before I got this, I was looking for a jewelry organizer that would be easy to use.  This is one of my favorite things about this organizer.  It's very simple to set up and the colors are perfect.  The only complaint I have with it is that if you don't have time to put everything together in minutes, there will be no instructions on how to do so. If you need an organizer that can hold all your jewelry items, then this might be the best solution.  If you're not familiar with any kind of organizer, or just want to get rid of some sort of messy mess, then this could be what you're looking for!

I have read all of the other books in my life but one is more like ""Whoopi Roberts""... The only thing I don't like about this book is how easy it is to set up.  The instructions are hard to follow because you have to go through several steps before setting your hands on each step.  You will need an internet browser to figure out how to set up.  If you do not know how to set up, then there is no way to get started.  That said, if you just want to make sure everything is set up as quickly as possible, you won't be able to use any tools at all.  There are many different ways to set up...",NON-GUIDED

The strap itself is really easy to put together, but you have to be careful not to over tighten the strap as your hand will get caught in the middle. The only thing i don't like about this watch is that there are no instructions on how to turn it on or off.  That being said, if you want to change the position of the dial (for example by turning the clockwise/clockwise) just go ahead and set the time at 12:00 am instead of 12:00 pm I would definitely recommend this watch for anyone looking for a simple way to control their watches.",NON-GUIDED

Video DVD,"Firstly, let me start by saying that I am not a fan of Blu-Ray discs.  The reason I bought this DVD was due to the fact that it is made in China. I have watched many movies and TV series over the past few years (including ""The Sopranos"", ""Home Entertainment Tonight"" and ""Good Morning America""). There are so many different DVD's out there that I can't even begin to comprehend how they work.  Some simply don't do what you want them to do.

Most people who buy DVDs for home entertainment may find themselves stuck with these types of disc selection at first glance.",NON-GUIDED

It holds all kinds of tools, screws, etc. It's easy to put together without having to use any tools at all.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars would be if you don't know how to assemble it.  There are so many things that need to be done before putting it together (e.g., drill holes for screwing).

If you want to charge your gas for less than an hour or more then just plug in some extra battery (which isn't recommended by any auto mechanic).

Luggage,"First of all, I wanted to share my experience with the luggage company.  They are very helpful in making sure that you have a good bag and don't take up too much space inside your suitcase.

Video DVD,"On Demand Blu-ray player works great.  I've used it for a couple of movies, including ""The Hurt Locker"" and ""Home Improvement.""  It's very easy to use as well. If you're looking for an entertainment DVD player that will capture all the action in your home theater, this may not be the case.  You can't go wrong with this player! I'm glad I did.  The picture quality is outstanding.  There are so many different types of DVDs available on the market right out of the box.  However, if you're looking for something that captures all the action in your home theater, look no further.

Outdoors,"Ok, I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son.  He loves it so much he can take it out on his own without having to worry about the dog barking or anything. It's easy to put together and is very well made.  There are plenty of holes in the middle that allow you to make sure your children don't get too excited when they go outside.  The only thing we didn't like was how long it would last (about 5-8 months).  We had some problems with other parts but these were great! I highly recommend this product.",NON-GUIDED

These mini-marathons allow you to create your own mini-marathons with no special tools or gimmicks.

Pros:<br />1) Easy installation (easy to install)<br />2) Easily installs without having to worry about setting up or shutting off your computer if you don't want to do anything else.<br />3) Doesn't take up much space on the hard drive side of the case so there is no need to unload files from SD card slot.<br />4) Does not have any issues with flash memory but does allow me to transfer files via USB instead of using an ethernet cable.  Also doesn't get as many disk drives as other DVD/Blu-ray players which are more prone to crashes due to poor setup.

Kitchen,"I've had this for a couple of years now and it has held up very well.  I have to say that the quality is as good as any. The instructions are pretty easy to follow, so you don't have to figure out how to use them at all.  You can just type in your own words or numbers (e.g., “#34;”&#34;). It's been quite awhile since I started using my stove top cookware but once I get used to it seems like time will tell.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is due to the fact that there seem to be no instructions on which to put the ingredients into each pot.  If you're trying to add more than one tablespoon of olive oil per cup of water, they won't even come through if you try to do so.",NON-GUIDED

The characters and story are so well developed, it makes you feel like you've actually read any of the books before.  There were some really good points about how they came together in just a few short chapters.  As far as character development goes, there are plenty of twists and turns throughout the book.  For example, one character has his own personality (a secret).  Another character has his own struggle with getting out of his parents' car while on vacation.  In another case, he becomes obsessed with losing his mother because she doesn't want him around anymore.  Finally, at the end of the chapter, he tries to get out of his car when he accidentally pulls her out of the car due to what happened between him and mom.",NON-GUIDED

Video DVD,"I'll be back in a couple of days.  I don't know how long it will last, but if you're going to watch this movie or any other series on blu-ray then go for it. It's not as good as the Blu-Ray version though.  It doesn't have all that much action and there are plenty of moments where you can feel like your character is being pulled right out of the box.  The acting isn't what most people would normally expect from a film made for such a short period of time.  There aren't really any special effects (like some of the voice actors did in the previous films), but they do make an excellent job of conveying the emotions of those around you.

The only thing that annoys me most about this device is how easy it is to set up.  It does not have an internet connection so you can't do anything with it unless you want to recharge your battery every few days or at least two times a week.  If you don't know what's going on then there is no internet connection for you! I've used several different chargers over the years but none of them work as advertised.

You'll want to check out my other products on Amazon at least once before purchasing! I would definitely recommend this product if you don't have any desire to spend your money on anything else.  This is one of those items where you get what you pay for without having to go through many hoops in order to do so.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was due to the price.

The only thing I would add is that there are no instructions on how to adjust the brightness of the lamp (it's not clear).  If you don't know how to turn off the light then go ahead and use the &#34;power&#34; switch which turns off the lights as soon as you open the box.

Grocery,"Before I got started with this book, I was a little worried about the quality of the story.  However, after reading it, I decided to give it a try. I have read many books that are based on fairy tale stories and fairy tales in my life.  This is one of those things where you don't get what you pay for.  It's not as if your heart is full of fairy-tale goodness but rather an actual &#34;mystery&#34; which has some pretty interesting twists and turns.  The main plot line is very different from other fairy-tale gothic/fantastic fairy-tale characters.  There aren't any major plot points or dialogues either! There are lots of good fairy-tale mini-episodes here on Amazon so make sure you check them out before you buy anything else.",NON-GUIDED

Video DVD,"Arrived on time and I'm very happy with the purchase. The picture quality is good, there are a few minor annoyances but it's worth every penny. 1. You have to be careful not to use this device when you're trying to play DVDs or Blu-Ray discs in your home theater. 2. If you don't want to listen to any of the audio files that come with it, make sure you turn off the volume control after each transfer. It doesn't take long for me to figure out how to do so... 3. Once you've done that, go ahead and buy another disc from Amazon which will give you 3 months' free trial (you get what you pay for) if you decide to watch only one DVD/Blu-Ray movie at a time. This isn't an easy feat as most people won't even bother to do such a thing.",NON-GUIDED

There are so many things you can learn from this book: 1) You get what you pay for, and 2) You don't have to worry about your credit score being used as an excuse to buy something else (e.g., shoes, pens, etc.). 3) The story line is pretty straight forward - no need to go through every page until you figure out how to use it! 4) It takes some getting used to; however, there are plenty of times when you feel like you've just gotten tired of reading too much or feeling like you’re doing too much without any kind of closure.",NON-GUIDED

Outdoors,"Often times when I don't have time to use my tools on the ground, it's not a big deal.  However, this tool is very well made and does what it says it all about. Pros<br />1) It has an ergonomic handle that lets you hold your tools without having to rely on hand-held mop/tools (I've owned mine for more than 30 years). 2) The &#34;adjustable&#34; feature allows you to adjust the height or angle of the blade depending on where you are in the open door. 3) You can adjust the length of the blade by tilting the top part of the handle with either left or right thumb at the same time. 4) There is also a built-in ""slip lock"" feature that makes it easier to remove items from the floor if they aren't cut properly.",NON-GUIDED

PC,"Before I got this, I wanted to point out that it does not have a &#34;chip&#34;.  In fact, the instructions are pretty clear and easy to follow: 1. Make sure you read the instruction manual before setting up. 2. You will need an external power supply (a USB 3.0 cable) or something like that which is compatible with all of my other PowerPC products.  For example, if you don't want to use your PC directly on a networked router, make sure you turn off the power adapter in order to do so.  Otherwise, you'll be fine. 3. If you're going to use some kind of hard drive as a backup media player/media player, these may work for you.  However, they won't let you access any internal drives at all.",NON-GUIDED

Pros:<br />Cons:<br />1) You can't get enough cystic fibromyalgia without taking this medicated<br />2) The meditated sounds don't come out very well<br />3) There's no clarity at all<br />4) Only thing that makes me want to take this medmed every once in a while may be due to some side effects (myalgia doesn't last quite so long).",NON-GUIDED
Automotive,"Sometimes you have to buy a new one.  This is the first time I've owned a Ford F150, and it's been so good. I don't know if this will last for many years or even decades.  But over the past few years, there has been a change in my opinion about cars that are far more dependable on manual transmission than any other brand of car. As with all vehicles built specifically for automatic transmission, these transmissions can be quite expensive.  For some reason, they're not as reliable as those offered by OEMs (Roughly $20-$30 an hour auto transmission). However, once you figure out how to set up your own transmission without having to worry about getting bogged down trying to figure out how to make sure everything works properly while still making sure everything runs smoothly.",NON-GUIDED
Furniture,"Ok, so I thought it would be nice to have this on my front porch.  It's made of a very sturdy material and has plenty of room in the back for extra storage. The only thing that annoyed me was how easy it is to remove the screws from the sides as you do not want them sliding off into the middle of the house.  That being said, if you are going to use any kind of plastic or something like that, make sure they don't fall out! If you're looking for an inexpensive piece of furniture with lots of space (or maybe more) then this might be the perfect solution...",NON-GUIDED

I've been using Home Improvement Kits since I was 10 years old.  These have helped me focus my attention on what is needed in order to get things done properly.

Furniture,"I've owned several of these for the past few years.  I have to say, they are very well made and look great.  The colors are just what I was looking for. The only complaint I have with them is that if you wear a large dress this will not fit in your waistband or back pocket.  That would be an issue since it isn't as big as some other wedding dress t-shirts do.  It's pretty much impossible to put on shoes without wearing socks.

My father-in-law and I both bought it as a birthday present for his 3 year old to play with. My dad-in-law says he has never seen anything like this before (he is 5'3&#34;), so I decided to give it a try: 1.  The plastic parts are not really made out of real rubber, but you could see them coming off at some point if you didn't know what kind of material they were going to be. 2.  You can put these on your dresser/dresser necklaces or any other piece of clothing that doesn't look like real rubber. 3.",NON-GUIDED
Video Games,"Having said that, I have never been a fan of Call of Duty: Ghosts. However, this game is great for the first person shooter as it allows you to explore different areas and be able to customize your playstyle.

After about 5 minutes of use you can see that the battery is fully charged. I have not had any problems with the camera as far as batteries go.  The only thing I would like to point out is that there are no instructions on how to activate shutter speed so if you don't know what happens when the camera starts shooting then just press the &#34;button&#34; button at the top of the screen in order to activate shutter speed.

Electronics,"Works great.  I bought this as a replacement for the one that came with my DSi and it works very well.  The only thing i don't like is how long it takes to set up, you have to make sure everything is in place before you power it up.",GUIDED
Outdoors,"Well, I've had no problems with this product.  It's a very rugged piece of wood and is well made.  However, it has holes in the sides to keep things from sliding into your car.",GUIDED
Wireless,"We've been using this for a couple of years now and it works great.  We have to replace the batteries in order to get rid of them.  It is very easy to use. The only complaint I have is that there are no instructions on how to unplug the battery, so if you don't know what they're suppose to do, just go into the manual and type: [[ASIN:B004G1YQE&#34;]].",NON-GUIDED
Furniture,Nice set but the price was too high for it. I bought another set and this one is a bit more expensive.,GUIDED
Wireless,"Reasons I bought this for my iPhone 5s are: 1) It's very fast charging and does not take up much space. 2) You can't charge the phone directly from the charger, so you have to use a USB cable instead.",GUIDED
Camera,Best camera of its kind.,GUIDED
Camera,"We bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband and he loves it. It is very well made, easy to set up (he has plenty of space in his pocket) and the quality is good. The only complaint I have is that there are no instructions on how to remove the camera if you need one.",NON-GUIDED
Musical Instruments,"Firstly, I was very pleased with this set.  It is a great value for the money.  If you are looking for an instrument that can be used as a backdrop to any kind of music, this may not be the case.  However, if you are looking for something more classical or orchestral, this will definitely be your first choice.",NON-GUIDED
Apparel,"Generally speaking, I like the look of this item.  It is well made and looks great in person.",NON-GUIDED
Luggage,"Simply put, this is one of the best bags I've ever owned. It's lightweight and easy to carry. The only thing i don't like about this bag is that it doesn't have a zippered compartment on either side so you can store all your stuff in there without having to drag it around or tug it out if you want to use it for anything else.",NON-GUIDED
Shoes,"I'll be ordering more.  I ordered a size smaller than the pictured and it was just too big for me at first, but now that I am able to wear them on my feet, I will probably order another pair of these again.",NON-GUIDED
Toys,Most of these Jazzwares are made in the USA.  We have had them for a few weeks now and they still look great.,GUIDED
Beauty,"this product is perfect.  I have been using it for a couple of years now and love that it doesn't take up too much space in my purse.  It seems to last quite a while, but so far this has held up very well with no problems at all.",GUIDED
Home Entertainment,"I watch 3D movies on my computer.  I do not like the idea of owning a home entertainment system that does not have this capability. If you own a home entertainment system, then this is an excellent choice for you.",GUIDED
Kitchen,"Great product.  I would recommend this to anyone who needs a quick and easy way to cook food without having to worry about the dreaded “chicken crunchiness” that comes with it. This is one of my favorite kitchen utensils, especially if you are planning on making something for yourself or someone else in your family (or even friends!) I have tried other types of utensils as well, but none seem to be able to hold up very well at all.  The only reason I don't like them is because they do tend to last longer than regular utensils, which can lead to issues such as water droplets leaking through the utensils after each use.  It's also possible that some people will get tired of using too many utensils when trying to make their own meal.",NON-GUIDED
Pet Products,"Had problems with this product.  My dog loves it so much that I ordered a second one for him. This is the first time we have had issues with Pet Products products over the last several years.  He has been very picky about them and will continue to do so as long as he continues to use them.  If anything, they are not going away from us anytime soon.",NON-GUIDED
Beauty,"Apart from the fact that it is made in China, I am very happy with this product.  It has a lot of room to store my hair and look great on my face.  My only complaint is that if you are looking for something more feminine then these will not be what you need. Pros:<br />- Beautifully finished<br />- Easy to apply<br />- Looks good at night<br />- Lathers nicely<br />- Doesn't feel like drying out when wet<br />- Doesn't smell as bad as some other reviewers have said<br />- Will last longer than regular shampoo Cons:<br />- The price was too high (about US$8), so I decided to go ahead and buy another one instead.  If you're looking for something more feminine then these won't be what you need.",NON-GUIDED
Tools,"Firstly, I have to say that this is a very good product.  It does what it's supposed to do and doesn't take up much space at all.  My only complaint is that there are no instructions on how to use the included screw driver. I've used several different types of screwdrivers over the years with varying degrees of success.  The first one came down to me as having too many screws in place for easy assembly without any help from the manufacturer or anyone else.  This led to an issue where I was able to assemble my own screwdriver without assistance from the manufacturer.  However, once you're done assembling your own screwdriver, you'll want to check them out before doing so.  If you don't have time to read the manual (which might be helpful if you aren't already familiar with the steps listed above), then you should probably follow the directions provided by the manufacturer when assembling your own screwdriver.",NON-GUIDED

Beauty,"Firstly, I love this product.  It is a little bulky but it works great for me.",NON-GUIDED

Sports,Sometimes it's hard to find a better way to wear them.,NON-GUIDED
Camera,"Firstly, I wanted to give this camera a try.  It took me about an hour and a half to get the hang of my Canon DSLR. Second, it took me about 20 minutes to get the hang of the camera. Thirdly, there was no way to turn on the power button when you are in the middle of filming.  You will have to press the shutter release button while still being able to take some time to get the hang of the camera.",NON-GUIDED

Apparel,Simply beautiful.  I am very pleased with this item.  It is a great addition to my wardrobe. I will be buying more of these in the future.,NON-GUIDED
Kitchen,"If you're looking for a quick and easy way to cook, this is it.  It's exactly what I was looking for. Pros:<br />1) Easy cooking utensils (not included)<br />2) Simple instructions on how to prepare the ingredients<br />3) Cook time 1-2 hours in slow cooker after serving<br />4) Instructions can be tricky to follow if you don't have enough food left at the stove/boil time so make sure not to add too much water or let it sit overnight before adding more than one cup of boiling water! Cons:<br />1) You'll want to cut into small pieces by cutting into smaller pieces when making your dinner plate.  This will take forever to get all the pieces that are needed without damaging the plates.",NON-GUIDED
Grocery,"When i bought this, it was a gift for my daughter. She loves it and I am very happy with the purchase.",NON-GUIDED

Apparel,Love this stuff. One of the best things I've ever bought in my life.,GUIDED
PC,"Having read some of the other reviews, I decided to give this review a try.  It is very easy to set up and has all the bells and whistles you would expect from a gaming PC.  You will need an internet connection in order to get it installed.  There are no built-in security features that can be found at the bottom.",NON-GUIDED
Grocery,Just what I was looking for.  The quality is very good and the price is right.,NON-GUIDED
Lawn and Garden,"Recently purchased a new home for our 2 year old grandson.  He loves to play with it, so we decided to give this one a try. I love the fact that he can sit on his front porch without putting too much pressure on the sides of the wood.  This allowed him to put more stress on the sides than I would have otherwise! The only thing I didn't like about this was how easy it was to set up.  It takes some getting used to, but you don't have to be very careful when setting it up.  The instructions are pretty hard to figure out (at least in my opinion).  There are no instructions as to how to use them - just make sure your child is familiar with what they are trying to accomplish.  You will need an internet browser to find all the instructions.",NON-GUIDED
Camera,I was very pleased with this camera.  The quality of the pictures is outstanding.  I use it every day and have used many different cameras in my life.,GUIDED

If you are looking for a high-def gaming monitor to display all of your favorite video games, then this might be the best choice. Pros:<br />✅ Full HD (720p) and 1080p at 720p<br />✅ Built in HDMI port<br />✅ USB 3.0 ports<br />✅ Stereo sound bar<br />✅ Bluetooth 4.",NON-GUIDED

Automotive,"My son and I bought this for him.  He loves it! It is very easy to install. I have no problems installing the software on my 2006 Pontiac Sunfire, but we still had a lot of work to do before that was done.

Baby,"Firstly, let me start by saying that I do not like the smell of baby clothes.  If you are looking for a comfortable and well-made diaper bag to carry all your baby essentials, then this is it.  It's easy to put together in less than an hour. But first, don't get me wrong, there are plenty of options out there on the market (like these ones at Wal-Mart), so be sure to check them out! Also, if you are looking for something more compact/durable, look no further.  You will need some kind of solid material to hold baby items such as umbrellas, diapers, wipes, socks, etc.  These things tend to last quite a while; however, they can take up too much space when zipped open.  The biggest problem with these bags is that once opened, everything falls apart after about 30 minutes.",NON-GUIDED

Home Improvement,"Simply put, this is a great home improvement kit.  It's easy to set up and use. I have used it for over a year now (my kids are 5'3&#34;) and I'm very happy with the results.  My only complaint is that there seems to be no way to turn on or off the power button when you do not want your children to move around in the living room.  So far so good! It has been well received by my son-in-law since he was 2 years old.  We'll see how long we can keep him warm during his first week of intensive care.",NON-GUIDED
Baby,"I am soo glad I got this product.  It is a great size for my 2 1/2 year old daughter and she loves to play with it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the small size, but definitely not due to the nature of the packaging.",GUIDED
Home Entertainment,"I've had this for a while now and it has held up very well.

Grocery,"Booked for Christmas.  I love it!  It's very easy to set up, and has all the bells and whistles you'd expect from a brick-and-mortar store.  The only thing that annoys me most about this is how difficult it is to get things done. I have an old typewriter in my living room so when I'm trying to figure out how to do some sort of book layout, I don't know how to turn it on or off.  This one doesn't even work at all.  You just need to be careful what you're doing before turning it on/off.  That being said, if you want to make sure your typewriter does not come loose with any bells and whistles, there are no bells and whistles anywhere else you can put them.",NON-GUIDED

If you're willing to pay more than half the retail price of $1.99 (plus shipping charges), it might be worth it.

My dog has yet to see any signs of aggression from the dogs.  This is due in large part to the fact that she does not seem to have an aggressive behavior pattern. I don't know if my dog will continue to bark out loud when we are given food and treats as soon as they get used to it (probably sometime next week or so). My dog loves these treats!

There were no wobbles on either side of the frame that caused me to get so excited about putting it together.  The first thing I did was figure out how to make sure everything came together properly.  This is probably one of those things where you have to be careful when assembling your pieces.  If you don't know how to use them correctly, then there are many different ways to set them up.  For example, if you're going to decorate an apartment or something like that, go ahead and buy some plywood furniture (think wood cabinets).  In other words, if you want to build a home with lots of floor space, these will work well for what you need most.",NON-GUIDED

I have not had any problems with it, but if you are looking for something that will make your life easier by automating the whole assembly process take some getting used to.  The first thing I did was install the brackets on the side of the steering wheel.  This allowed me to adjust the length of the bolts so that they don't interfere with the car being able to drive at full speed without having to push the accelerator pedal while driving.  Then I installed the dash lights in my 2011 Ford Escape sedans.

There are several different levels that can be customized with varying degrees of difficulty depending on how well you play the game.  The main goal is to defeat certain enemies by defeating certain mini-bosses at various points throughout the game (e.g., Sonic the Hedgehog).  These mini-bosses are difficult to level after defeating certain mini-bosses during the course of the game.

Toys,"Generally speaking, these are a pretty good value.  They're sturdy and durable. I've been using them for about 6 months now and they seem to hold up very well even with heavy rain.  I don't know if it's because of the fact that my son doesn't have any water in his mouth or some other area but he is able to get out without having to do so.  The only reason I didn't give him 5 stars was due to the lack of air circulation (which might explain why we rated this item higher). The material seems to be made from natural materials rather than synthetic materials.  This means that you can't really see anything unless you look at it closely.  That being said, as far as durability goes, there isn't an exact way to determine which kind of material holds up better than what you would expect.",NON-GUIDED

Musical Instruments,"As expected.  I have not used any of these instruments in the past, so far this has been a success.  It is very easy to set up and operate with ease. The main thing that impressed me most was how well it performed on my own instrument.  The only complaint I have had is that you can't turn off the volume even if your hands are full.  If you don't want to adjust the volume at all, then there is no way to turn off the volume by simply pressing the key/somewhat more than once.  That's one of those things that annoys me about electric guitars.

You can use any type of utensil as long as you're careful not to over-tighten your utensils.  That said, if you don't want to tighten them while cooking, this might be an issue.

It plays DVDs on your computer without having to plug in extra cords.<br />3. There aren't any external hard drive devices connected to this player.<br />4.

Baby,"Greater than expected.  We have two of them and they seem to hold up very well.  The only thing I don't like about this is that it doesn't come with a cord or any kind of clip, so if you are in need of something for your baby the cord will be there.",NON-GUIDED
Pet Products,I was very disappointed with this product.  I have been using it for about 3 months now and am still not sure what the difference is.,GUIDED
Health & Personal Care,These work great!  I use them every morning to help with my acne scars.  They are easy to use and can be used as hand sanitizer if you have dry skin.,GUIDED
Tools,"As mentioned, this is a very heavy duty tool.  I have had it for some time and the handle has held up well.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the large weight on the back side.  It's not as sturdy as my previous Gerber 9-1/2&#34; but doesn't weigh much more than 1 lb.

Baby,"While I'm not sure if this is the case, it's nice to have a little room for your baby when you need them. I've been using these on my son's bed since he was 10 months old.  It works great! Pros:<br />- Easy to set up<br />- Compact and easy to use<br />- Cleanable<br />- Locks well<br />Cons:<br />- Doesn't feel as warm as some of the other brands that come out of Amazon If you're looking for something with less space (for example) then these are definitely what you'd be looking for.  They also don't seem like they'll last much longer than their regular ones.

Wireless,"Checkpoint is the most important thing to have in your pocket.  It's easy to set up and operate without having to rely on a power strip or other device. I've owned this for about 3 years now, so I can't say enough good things about it.  My only complaint is that there aren't any buttons at all: 1) The &#34;color&#34; of the screen is not as bright as my old ones (it doesn't appear to be).  There are also some minor annoyances with the color/coordination between the two screens.  For instance, if you're looking for an inexpensive wireless charger, look no further! 2) You don't need to worry about battery draining during charging.  That being said, batteries do tend to last longer than standard chargers, which means they won't last much longer.",NON-GUIDED

Musical Instruments,"Simply put, this is one of the best guitars I've ever owned.  It's a very well built guitar with great sound and good balance.  However, it has to be super heavy if you're going to play classical music. I don't have much use for heavier instruments such as those that are more commonly found in smaller venues.  The fact that they can also be played at lower volumes makes them difficult to find on-line. However, once you get your instrument set up, you'll want to keep an eye out for some kind of neck tuner.  This particular tuner isn't designed for all types of instruments but for people like myself who live primarily in South America or parts of Africa.  That being said, there aren't really any other tuners out there that will perform better than this one.",NON-GUIDED
Home Improvement,Didn't work for me at all.  I had to return it and get a new one.,NON-GUIDED
Luggage,"As described, this is a very nice size.  It's light weight and easy to carry. The only complaint I have is that the zipper on the back of the bag has not been tightened so you can't remove it from the luggage compartment (other than that). There are several holes in the inside of the bag which make it difficult to get out of the bag if you don't want to use your handbag for anything other than taking things with you or someone else.

The only complaint I have is that some of the screws on the front end do not come off easily.  That may be due to the large number of screws in the back or because they don't fit into the wall properly.  But if you need an inexpensive tool like this, then this would be a good buy.",NON-GUIDED

It's easy to read and has lots of cool features.  You can customize it based on how many books you like or dislike.  The only downside is that there isn't much in-between pages (or more).  If you want to keep an eye on what others have been saying, then these might not hold up very well at all.  However, once you get used to them, they don't seem to bother you as long as you stay away from them. 2. There aren't really any great books out there with tons of cool features.

You can adjust the speed of the engine by turning on/off or setting the air flow rate depending on your preference. I don't have any issues with battery longevity as long as you are careful not to overheat the car in front of you.  This is especially true if you are driving under 100 miles an hour (or more).

Lawn and Garden,"Here's my review: 1.  I bought this to use in a garden hose. 2.  It works great! 3.  My only complaint is that it doesn't seem to work well at all.  If you're trying to make sure your hose isn't leaking, the directions don't say how to do so.  In other words, if you want to make sure your hose isn't leaking, then go ahead and buy one of these (or maybe two) because they are cheaper than what you can get for less.",NON-GUIDED
Video DVD,"Not bad for the money.  The picture quality is good, but it's not as good as a Blu-ray player. The only reason I gave 4 stars is that you can't really see all of the different scenes in the movie.  There are two main characters (Bernadette and Walter) who want to go out into the woods together with each other.  They have no idea what they're going to do when they get back from their vacation.  That doesn't help either because there are so many different movies on this list.  It's hard to figure out how to watch any of these movies without reading up on some of them.  In my opinion, if you've ever seen anything like ""Crazy Ex-Girlfriend"" or ""Beauty and the Beast"" then you probably won't be disappointed.",NON-GUIDED

It's a little hard to get used to them because they aren't as well developed as some of the other games out there.",NON-GUIDED
Apparel,Arrived quickly and arrived in perfect condition.  I am very pleased with the quality of this item.,NON-GUIDED
Video DVD,"After a few months of use, I decided to give this DVD a try.  It's not very good quality but the sound is great and you can't go wrong with it. Pros:<br />1) The Blu-ray player has some nice features that make it easy to play DVDs faster than any other player on the market (i.e., if you don't have multiple discs). 2) There are so many options available for different types of movies - including VHS, PS3, 4K, etc. Cons:<br />1) If you're looking for something more portable like an MP3 player or DVD player, these may not be your thing!  You get what you pay for in HD instead of WAV files.  That said, there are plenty of alternatives out there which will allow you to enjoy all kinds of movies without having to worry about getting sucked into too much territory.",NON-GUIDED
Camera,"The Nikon D3-D is a great value.  It's easy to set up, and it works well with my Canon EOS 7D.  If you're looking for a digital camera that can capture all of your shots without having to worry about getting caught in the middle of a shoot, I highly recommend this camera.",GUIDED

Musical Instruments,"Used this instrument for many years.  I have had no problems with it as far as performance. It is a very nice sounding instrument and has plenty of room to play in the back seat if you don't want to put your hands on something that doesn't vibrate at all (e.g. drums, etc.).",NON-GUIDED
Automotive,"Ok, I've only had this for a couple of months now.  This is one of the best auto repair kits out there. Pros:<br />- Easy to install and operate<br />- Built in power supply<br />- Includes extra batteries (not included)<br />- Installation instructions are very easy<br />- The manufacturer states that they can't be installed on your vehicle if you don't have an outlet.<br />- There's no way to turn off the air freshener or heat sensor so it doesn't come into contact with water<br />- No need to worry about odors!<br />Cons:<br />- Not sure what else could be added?<br />- Doesn't seem like much at all...",NON-GUIDED

Luggage,"We've been using this luggage for a couple of months now.  It's very comfortable and easy to carry. The only thing I don't like about it is that there are no compartments on the side, so you have to be careful not to put too many compartments in each compartment.  There are two compartments (two small ones at the top).  The other one is just behind the back of the suitcase.  When we got home from work, our luggage was already full with lots of stuff! I would definitely recommend this bag if you're looking for something more compact or heavy-duty.",NON-GUIDED

Luggage,"Often times when I need a suitcase for work, the luggage is always packed in this bag.  It's very easy to use and holds all kinds of things including clothes, books, papers, credit cards etc. The only thing that keeps me from carrying out my business is the fact that it doesn't come with an external hard case so if you don't have enough space then there are no extra compartments on the inside which can be used as storage bags (as well as other items). If you want something smaller then this one will definitely hold up quite well.",NON-GUIDED
Shoes,"It arrived in a timely manner and was packaged well.  The only complaint I have is that the stitching on the back side of the bag does not line up with the front zipper so if you don't like it, make sure to take care of your bags before putting them all together.  They are very cheaply made and will likely last a long time.",NON-GUIDED
Toys,"Ok, but I don't know if it's the quality of these shoes.  The leather is a bit too soft for my liking and feels like they are made from real leather. I would rate this as a very high quality shoe.  It looks more like fake leather than real leather at some point in the future.  But that doesn't mean there aren't any issues with them either.  If you're looking for something classy to wear everyday, look no further.",NON-GUIDED

Kitchen,"Just what I was looking for in a kitchen sink.  This one is exactly what I needed!  It has all the bells and whistles you would expect from a kitchen sink, but it's also very easy to set up. The only complaint I have is that some of the buttons are not as intuitive as my other KitchenAid products.  If you don't know how to use them correctly, this will ruin your experience.  However, if you're just trying to figure out how to use them correctly, they won't work at all unless you've tried several different methods before.  You'll be hard pressed to figure out how to use them correctly without resorting to manual hand-wringing.",NON-GUIDED
Furniture,We really loved this one.  It is very well made and the colors are great.  The only thing I didn't like was how long it would take to get my hands on it.  If you don't have a lot of space in your purse then that's not what we were looking for.,GUIDED

If you're looking for an outdoor toolbox or something like that, make sure you read the manual first before purchasing.",NON-GUIDED

It has made me want to buy more DVDs as soon as possible! If you are looking for an action/adventure movie that will entertain your heart's content then this may not be what you were looking for.  If you like action/adventure look no further than The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, or even Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, then this might not be how you would feel if you didn't know all the latest information on who actually played the lead role in this film.

This is one of those things where you don't want to have to worry about your PC shutting down and turning on every once in a while. There are so many different ways this can work for me... 1) Plug-In USB 2.0 or 3.0 ports (3.5mm x 1.75mm) will allow you to plug in any kind of USB device that isn't compatible with my laptop/tablet.

I highly recommend this product.",NON-GUIDED
Video DVD,"Even though I am a diehard fan of Blu-Ray movies, this is one of the best DVDs I have ever seen. I was looking for a DVD player that would allow me to play my favorite films.  It took me about an hour and 45 minutes to come up with what I needed.  The only thing I didn't like was how slow it was to start playing when you first started playing them.  That's why I decided to give it 4 stars instead of 5! If you are new to Blu-raying, then this may not be your cup of tea.  If you're just looking for a movie that will keep you entertained while watching some of the best action/thriller movies on the market right now, don't hesitate to check out: http://www.amazon.",NON-GUIDED

However, once you get used to being able to see your eyes without glasses or eyeglasses (which isn't what I was looking for in my daily life), then having these glasses won't help much.

If you want to use blu ray discs or other media (such as MP3 players), this might work just fine! The only problem I have is that there is no audio output on this player so if you don't know what's going on, make sure you read the instructions first before using Blu Ray disc.

I bought two of these in hopes that they would work well on our dining room table (they're too expensive).  They are good quality, but my wife didn't want me to use them because she couldn't fit her large flat screen perfectly without them being placed next to each other! This one is very sturdy and does not wobble at all.  However, you can easily adjust the height or tilt of the desk by adjusting the angle of the chair from left to right.

This fits my needs very well. The zippers are comfortable but not too tight or too loose. My only complaint is that they do take some getting used to because of the large amount of padding around them.

That said, if you're looking for an easy way to get started without having to go through any more complicated steps, then this may not be the case.

You can adjust the length of the button by changing the position of the &#34;keyboard&#34; from 1/4&#34; to 2/8&#34;.

The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is due to how easy it is to set up.  If you're looking for something simple and inexpensive with lots of options, go ahead and buy from Amazon.

It's hard to get enough people in your home theater system to enjoy it.  You have to listen to the music on both VHS and DVD players so you don't need to worry about getting too close to each other.

My only complaint would be that there were no instructions for how to remove or replace the jewelers' screws. Update: The screw holes in the bottom of the box are too small (about 2 1/2&#34; wide by 3/8&#34; long).  They're not supposed to hold anything at all.  If you don't want to use them as many screws as possible, they won't even fit into your door frame.",NON-GUIDED

Musical Instruments,"Before I got this, I thought it would be interesting to see if the range was really good or not.  It's a little loose in terms of how much you can adjust your tone depending on which instrument you're using.  However, for me, that hasn't been a big issue so far.  The sound is decent and very clear with no distortion whatsoever.  There are plenty of instruments out there that don't have any distortion at all.  That being said, I didn't want to spend too much time trying to figure out how to use them without sounding like an amateur.  This isn't my first foray into electronic music (although I've never used anything similar).  In fact, I'm always looking for ways to get myself into some sort of jamming/drumming territory where I can more easily do what I love best.",NON-GUIDED

Using the included power cord on both sides of the stand - I was able to get him to use his left hand without any problems. 3. Connecting the unit to the wall/carpet has been a breeze since we first put it on...we've had no issues connecting it to the wall or anything else. 4.",NON-GUIDED

The only thing I don't like about this product is the fact it doesn't have an expiration date, which makes it easy to figure out how to get started with. It's hard to know what day of the week other than 6 am in the morning (I've been doing math).",NON-GUIDED
Sports,"I'm not sure if I'll be able to use this product again, but it's definitely worth the money. If you're looking for a high quality sports gear that will last your whole life, look no further. This is one of my favorites... The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars would be because there are so many things out there: 1. The color(s) isn't quite what you'd expect from an expensive watch face. It's almost as bright and vibrant as some of the other faces in the line up. 2. You can adjust the brightness/darkness settings manually depending on how much you want them to go. 3. There aren't any adjustments made at all (lens, sunscreens, etc).  So far they seem to work fine. 4.",NON-GUIDED
Shoes,"Meets my expectations.  I have a pair of these shoes and they fit perfect.  They are well made and the shoe is very comfortable to wear.

Home Improvement,"Great product.  I bought it as a Christmas gift for my husband and he loves it!  It is very simple to set up, easy to install and has the following features: 1) Easy installation. 2) Adjustable height adjustment. 3) The unit can be adjusted by turning on/off (or off depending on your needs).  This will allow you to adjust the height of the unit in any direction without having to worry about adjusting the height of the unit itself.  For example, if you are going to use an extension cord or something like that, this would make it easier to adjust the height of the unit when needed.

Video DVD,"Away Blu-Ray player works great.  I bought it for my son who is a movie buff so he can play all kinds of movies on the go. Pros:<br />1) It's easy to use and plays as well as any other blu-ray player.<br />2) There are no built in remote control buttons, which means you don't have to rely on your computer to do that.<br />3) The picture quality is very good compared to Sony's PS4 or Xbox One.<br />4) You'll be able to take pictures without having to worry about getting lost in menus.<br />Cons:<br />1) If you're looking for an entertainment center with lots of video cameras, this may not be the best choice.<br />2) A lot of people seem to think there must be some kind of HDMI port (or something like that).

I like the fact that there are no instructions on how to use &#34;keyboard&#34; in order to activate &#34;activation&#34; of my iPad. The only thing i don't like about this one is that you have to be careful not to press any key while your child is playing or reading/reading at the same time.  This device does exactly what it was supposed to do: It lets you know when something is going to happen during certain periods of time (e.g., an hour or more) without having to press any key while still being able to enter &#34;activities&#34; which can be done by pressing &#34;fingerprints&#34; after each period of time.",NON-GUIDED

If you are looking for an easy way to clean your PC after installing the OS, this might be the perfect solution. However, if you're just looking for something simple with minimal fussiness or lack of storage space, this may not be the case. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that there were no instructions on how to remove the screws from the mounting area (which had already been removed). For those who don't want to use any kind of heavy-duty tools such as shavers, pliers, saws, etc., then this would probably be the perfect solution. If you need some sort of sturdy tool at home, look no further than this one.",NON-GUIDED

Baby,"When I was a little kid, my dad would hang out in the backseat of his truck and not have to worry about it falling off.  So when he saw this one on Amazon, we were very happy with it! It's hard to put together because there are so many things you can't do if you don't have enough pieces. The only thing that kept me from doing was putting all the pieces together without worrying about it falling off (or something else).  It didn't fall off any more than once or twice as fast as some other car doors/traffic lights...it just sort of fell off into the middle of the garage around 5:45am.

This is especially useful if you want to make sure your appliances don't move too far out of the living room due to the amount of space they're able to put into them. Cons<br />1. There aren't any built-in air vents at all for things like cabinets, bathrooms, etc.  The only thing we didn't like was the lack of venting which made me feel like I wasn't doing anything right.",NON-GUIDED

Excellent sound quality for a relatively inexpensive price.<br />4. Does what it is supposed to do so well.<br />5. Very easy to play DVDs without having to unpack them.<br />Cons:<br />1. Unfortunatly not very useful at all.<br />2. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad I bought this unit because I don't want to spend hundreds of dollars or even thousands of dollars on something that doesn't work just fine (i.e., you have to figure out how to make sure everything works).<br />3. Doesn't take up too much space when there are lots of different media options available.<br />4.",NON-GUIDED

If you're looking for something that will entertain and entertain all ages, here are my suggestions: 1. Do what you need to do. 2. Look at it as a movie with lots of action scenes (like in ""The Hurt Locker"" where one character is killed by his partner), and make sure there aren't too many plot threads throughout the entire movie. 3. Make sure everyone has an idea of how to go about getting rid of those bad guys. 4. Listen to music! 5. Don't get me wrong, I listen to music from several different sources.",NON-GUIDED

It looks great and has a nice feel to it. 2)  The face is beautiful, the band is easy to put together, and the strap is made of sturdy plastic. 3)  My only complaint is that the buckle does not come off easily when you wear it. If you are looking for a way to protect your wrist from being pulled over or slammed into an object like this, then this might be just what you're looking for. You can't really do that unless you don't have fingers on either side (or if you've got hands on both sides). 4)  This is one of those watches that doesn't seem to hold up well in terms of time.",NON-GUIDED

Video DVD,"Elegant Blu-ray player. I've been using it for a while now, and I'm glad I did.  It's nice to have the ability to watch movies on my computer without having to worry about getting lost in any of the other features that come with it.  There are so many things you can't do wrong with this player: 1. You'll need an internet connection to play DVDs or Blu-Ray discs.  The player comes with 2 USB ports (3.0 x 3.0 x 1.2) which allow you to plug in as many devices as you want.  If you don't have multiple computers at your disposal, you can easily switch between them by turning off the power button.  This allows you to transfer videos from one device to another via blu-ray.  That works great if you're just trying to keep everything connected after each movie is over.",NON-GUIDED
Video DVD,"Seriously, this movie is a rip-off of classic westerns.  It's not as good or better than any other film I've ever seen. If you are looking for an alternative to the cult classic look no further.  This one has some interesting twists and turns that don't quite get into the heart of it all.  The only real downfall here is that there isn't much action in this movie.  You just have to watch it over and over again before you can even begin to understand what really happened.  That said, if you're looking for something more serious like this, then this is probably your go-to movie for you.",NON-GUIDED

This will also be useful if you need to change the color of your screen depending on which one you are using.

This device works well with my Verizon FiOS 4G LTE modem which seems to be more than adequate if you're willing to spend thousands of dollars on something else.

However, there are many things about this strap: 1. The &#34;Adjustment&#34; is really just adjusting the length of the strap with your left or right hand pointing downward (e.g., turning the angle at which the arm restrests).  You can also adjust the height of the strap by simply holding the side of the strap down while using the other adjustment methods.

There are some minor annoyances with this player so far: 1. It doesn't play DVDs or Blu-ray discs at all (i.e., if you don't have an HDTV) 2. There's no audio output on this player which isn't particularly useful for streaming video to your home theater speakers! 3. You can't stream movies/titles via blu-ray unless you're willing to pay more than $10 per disc transfer fee in order to do so.

There is nothing in the manual that tells you what to do.  It doesn't even give you any instructions on how to use it.

It also has an adjustable height to allow you to adjust how long it stays inside your garden.  It's not too big or too small (at least) but just enough to keep things from tipping over if you don't want to leave it hanging at all. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because there are no instructions on how to set it up as well as some other info about how to make it work: Pros: Cons: Cost: Unable to install correctly without having to do anything else.

It is very well made with good quality materials but not too flimsy at all.  The only complaint I have is that the sides can be bent if you try to roll them up or down depending on how tall they are.  They will bend over time (about 3&#34; long).  This isn't an issue as far as bending your fingers when trying to do anything else.  You could easily get rid of these by cutting some wood pieces off before doing any other kind of thing.",NON-GUIDED

I love the fact that there's no expiration date on this one! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of how easy it is to use.  It doesn't take up too much room or too much space (or so I thought).  If you don't have an adult sized toy like mine, then this may not be the way to go.  There are plenty of toys out there that can hold more than 1/4&#34; of whatever size fits your needs.  However, if you do have kids with smaller hands, then this might be the way to go.

Watches,I love the style and look of this watch.  It is very well made and looks great on my wrist. The only complaint I have is that you can see a small dot in the top right corner of the watch face which makes it difficult to see if there is an indicator or not.,GUIDED
Baby,My 5 month old loves this toy. It is a little bulky but I love the fact that it can be attached to any other piece of furniture so you don't have to worry about getting scratched or anything like that.,GUIDED

Health & Personal Care,"I'm so glad I purchased this product.  My husband and I have been using it for a couple of years now. It's easy to use, doesn't take up too much space or is not very well organized.  The only thing i didn't like was that the directions don't say how to put food in your mouth if you're going to eat anything other than water There are no instructions on how to get rid of all the messes but they do help me figure out how to keep things clean without having to worry about getting caught by something else. My husband has tried several different products over the years with varying degrees of success as he continues to improve his diet.",NON-GUIDED
Lawn and Garden,"When I was a little kid, my dad would hang out in the back of his truck.  We bought this for our 2 year old son who is 5'1&#34; so that he could play with it as long as he wanted. He loved playing with it! It's not hard to get your hands dirty when you put it on but if you don't use any kind of soap or detergent (like some other brands) then there are no worries about spills.  The only thing we didn't like was how big it actually was because it wasn't too big at all.  It held up very well without being too big which made me wish it wouldn't hold up much longer. We were able to wash it off before putting it on yet another truck full of toys.",NON-GUIDED
Luggage,"Used it on my last trip and was very pleased with the quality of the product.  The leather is a bit softer than I expected, but not so soft as to make your luggage look cheap or anything like that.",NON-GUIDED

Baby,"I got this for my 2 year old and she loves to play with it.  She's always playing with it, but I'm not sure if that is due to the size of the toy itself or just a lack of room in the crib.  It doesn't fit her very well so we ended up returning it.",GUIDED
Tools,"Not very good quality.  I have been using this for a couple of years now and it seems to work just fine.  The only thing that bothered me is how long the battery life lasts.  If you are going to charge your phone every 2-3 months, these may not last much longer.",GUIDED

Home Entertainment,"First time I saw this game, it was a must have.  The graphics are good and the story is well developed.  My only complaint is that you will not be able to play as many games as you want.  It took me about 5 minutes to figure out how to load all of the games.",NON-GUIDED

Video Games,"Sometimes it's hard to find a good video game for the money.  I've been playing Call of Duty on Xbox 360 for almost two years now, and haven't had any problems with this one either.  The only problem is that you have to go through all kinds of hoops to get there.  It took me about an hour to figure out how to enter each level (in my opinion) so I didn't have to do anything at all.",NON-GUIDED
Watches,Was very pleased with the quality of the watch.  The face is easy to read and has a great feel to it.,NON-GUIDED
Toys,"Do not want to be in the same room.  This is a great way to put your hands on something that doesn't need to be there for you. The only problem I have with this product is it's very hard to open and close all of the plastic parts, which means they won't get into any of the corners or anything like that.",NON-GUIDED
Home Entertainment,"These TVs are great.  They come in a variety of colors, but they do not have all the bells and whistles you would expect from any home entertainment system. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that it's difficult to set up your own TV without having an internet connection.",GUIDED

Video DVD,"Seriously, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's a must have for anyone who wants to get into movie history.  There are plenty of good reasons why you can't go wrong with this film: 1. The acting and dialogue are so well choreographed that they make it almost impossible to watch them in person. 2. Director Guillermo Del Toro has done an excellent job portraying Arnold Schwarzenegger as he tries to seduce Arnold at some point during the filming of his upcoming ""Godzilla"" movie. 3. He doesn't seem to be particularly interested in Paul Newman (Robert De Niro), nor does he care much about any of the rest of the cast. 4. In fact, if you're looking for something more serious, look no further than ""The Hurt Locker"".",NON-GUIDED

Home Improvement,"After three months of use, I decided to return this unit because it was a bit bulky.  It took me about an hour and a half to put together the first unit. I have yet to see how well it performs on my kitchen sink or bathroom scale.  The only reason I haven't given it 5 stars is that you will need to manually adjust the height of the screws so they don't move at all.  There are no instructions on how to set them up but once you've done that, there's plenty of time to figure out how to make them work.  If you're looking for something simple to assemble with minimal effort, this might be the way to go.",NON-GUIDED

Books,"What's new about this book is that it tells the story of a young man and his struggle with addiction to drugs.  I'm not going to go into much detail here, but suffice it to say that there are many things you can learn from this book. 1. Don't get me wrong, my experience with addiction has been very helpful for me.  It helped me figure out how to deal with addiction without becoming addicted to drugs.  There were times when I was inebriated at some point where I would stop eating or taking any other form of junk food (such as crack).  In those times, I wouldn't want to do anything more than eat something that made me feel like I had no choice but to try something that made me feel better.  This book definitely gave me an edge over others who have struggled with addiction even though I didn't know what they were dealing with.",NON-GUIDED
Baby,"Generally speaking, I have not had any problems with this product.  However, if you are looking for an easy to use diaper bag that will hold all of your baby's diapers in one place, this is it! I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and ease of delivery as well. The only reason I didn't get a 4 star rating was because there were no instructions on how to set up or when to put them together.  It took me about 5 minutes to figure out what would be required to do so.  The instructions weren't helpful at all, but they helped me figure things out quickly (and then just left my door open without having to go through those). Overall, I am very pleased with this product.",NON-GUIDED

I love all the different types of pans that are available at the local grocery stores as well.  It's so much easier to put together than sitting on your kitchen counter trying to figure out how to make something from scratch.  The pan comes pre-heated (with an air seal) and ready to be tossed into the dishwasher if necessary.  You can also use any other type of pan with this handy little tool.",NON-GUIDED

The only thing wrong with this bag is that it does not have a zipper on the side so you can't really see anything out of the box.  There are about 1/4&#34; of zippered pockets inside which make it very easy to slip into your purse.

One of my favorite games is Call of Duty: Black Ops III.  There are so many great games out there that you can't really figure them all out.  You have to go through dozens of levels before you can get what you pay for.  It took me about 30 minutes to figure out how to do it.  This game has tons of replay value too.

The color is not really what you would expect from an expensive watch.  There are so many different colors in this price range which makes it difficult to find something that matches your needs.  My only complaint is that some of the numbers don't come with the strap though.  That may be due to the length of the strap itself being too short for most of the time.  This could have been fixed by changing the strap instead of adding the zippered closure at the end of the strap rather than using the velcro closure as shown in the picture. 4.",NON-GUIDED

If you're looking for an instrument that will last forever, this is it!  It's not too heavy or flimsy to hold in your hand while playing with other instruments.  The best part about them is that if you want to play music without having to worry about getting hit by someone else (or somebody else) at the same time...you know what?  If you need some kind of electronic instrument but don't mind being hit by someone who doesn't use any kind of electronic instrument then these are definitely the right instrument for you.",NON-GUIDED

If you don't want to spend hours playing ""Dawn of Darksiders"" or ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3"" then this is the game for you.  You will not be able to play any of the other games at all.  The only real complaint I have about this game is its lack of replay value.  That said, if you haven't played Call of Duty yet, let me tell you something.  There are so many great video games out there (and maybe even better ones) that offer replay value.  For example, Plants vs.",NON-GUIDED

I'm still trying to figure out how to use all the different types of diapers we put on our babies so they don't end up with cramps or other side effects from having to take them off each day during their diaper break-in.

Home Entertainment,"I'd like to say that this is one of the best games I've ever seen.  It's a very well-made game for kids and adults alike.  The graphics are nice, but you can't really go wrong with it. The controls are pretty straight forward (in terms of how they're supposed to be).  You have to click through several hoops to get access to certain parts of the game.  There isn't much going on in regards to jumping around obstacles or defeating certain types of enemies.  That being said, if you do jump around many levels at different times, then there aren't any major problems whatsoever. There are some minor graphical glitches which may cause me to skip over most of the gameplay.  For instance, an older version of the game was not able to play all of the levels correctly.",NON-GUIDED

She loves it so much she doesn't have to worry about getting dirty or anything like that. It's not too big but you can put it on top of her bed if you want! The only thing we didn't do was make sure there were no &#34;wings off&#34; as some had said before (we don't use them all the time!) We ended up making an even bigger mess than what we already had done.  It took us several days to figure out how to clean it after just one day using it.

Automotive,"I bought this for my son and he loves it.  It is easy to adjust the speed of the engine, but with a little help I can do that. The steering wheel has an adjustable height adjustment so you don't have to worry about turning too hard or too slow.  There are plenty of options on the left side which allow you to adjust the car's front wheels as well.  You can adjust the amount of torque by adjusting the cruise control dial depending on how many turns each turn.  The center console also allows you to adjust the weight of the fuel tank in order to increase the flow of the air through the tire.

This can be done by rubbing some air between the nose and mouth area before using the aerosol spray/skewed onto the surface in order to make sure they aren't getting caught up in the odor. 2) Do not apply any other chemicals besides benzoyl peroxifosamine(Benzophenone), which has been shown to work well for many years now due to its anti-doping properties.",NON-GUIDED

The only thing that surprised me was how small the LCD readout was (about 1/8&#34;).  It wasn't big enough to fit into my wrist and doesn't hold up well at all.

The installation instructions are pretty straightforward: 1. Connect the Power Adapter (a.k.a. USB 3.0 port) into your computer via ethernet or through netbook(s). 2. Plug in the Ethernet cable that came with my ipad so I can watch movies on blu ray/pixel devices.  This allows me to watch more movies online without having to worry about getting caught by someone who doesn't know how to get caught. 3. Install the software as described above.

It's hard to find DVDs that have better quality than those that don't even come in at all.  This DVD does what it's supposed to do: Unfortunatly enough, there are no HD DVD's out there for streaming (i.e., Netflix or Hulu Plus) but you can stream from one box to another via blu-ray instead of having to go through an internet connection.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because people who want to watch movies on their computers aren't able to play them on any computer connected to your TV.",NON-GUIDED

These weapons also come with an unlockable mini-boss system which allows you to choose between two or more mini-bosses in various ways.

They are very well built and easy to set up.  They have plenty of bass preamps that can be turned on/off depending on your preference.  For example, if you want to play classical music (or at least listen to jazz) or orchestral music from an acoustic instrument, this is it! The second thing I like most about these are the fact that they don't vibrate as loudly as some others.  If you're looking for a way to get those sounds out without having to do so, these may not be the best choice.

I have not had any issues with it so far but if you are looking for an automotive that can do more then just plug in the power adapter on your Honda Civic or something like that The only thing I would say is that there is no built-in remote control (not included).  This will allow you to adjust the speed of the car by adjusting the speed of the car as well as how fast the air gets out of the front tire.

The characters are human beings who have different beliefs about God and how we should be able to live our lives without being influenced by those beliefs.

First of all, let me start by saying that I do not have any sympathy for those who are killed or wounded in an armed conflict.  The first thing I want to point out is that when I was a child, my father had been on the verge of being shot at least once (probably due to his lack of physical strength).  When he was 10 years old, we were living in a rural area with lots of trees growing along the way.  In fact, our house wasn't even close enough to the front door so we could hardly see through it.  However, as time went on, everything seemed to be going according to plan.  We decided to go ahead and buy something different.",NON-GUIDED

It is very easy to put on and off if you don't have enough space. I like that there are no zipper compartments in the luggage compartment which make it easier to carry his stuff around without having to worry about getting caught up in the zipper or tipping over at him.

It's not super wide-angle but you can't really tell if your hands are full of pixels.

The only thing missing from this was the small size of the box itself.  There were no instructions or instructions at all so we had to go ahead and buy something else.  We didn't even bother to send it back because our son doesn't want us to return it.  He hasn't been able to figure anything out yet but once we figured it out there was plenty of room for him to do whatever he wanted.

Baby,"When I was a little kid, my parents would listen to &#34;Love&#34; songs.  This is the first time we have listened to &#34;Love&#34; music in our whole life. I've been listening to &#34;Love&#34; for about 2 months now and love it so much! The only thing that kept me from buying this album (and at least two other albums) was the fact that they didn't bother to add any new songs since their last one came out just a few weeks ago.  It's hard to imagine them ever going back or even getting used to ""Love&#34; again"" because of how often these songs come out every single day.  So if you're looking for something like &#34;Love&#34; on your wish list, don't waste your money.",NON-GUIDED

Health & Personal Care,"Here's a list of the best and least expensive health care packages available.  I have tried several different types of products, but none worked for me. Pros:<br />-Cons:<br />-The price is too high to be worth it (about $100)<br />-You get what you pay for!<br />-There are so many things that can make your life worse...<br />-It doesn't feel right at all in my mouth when I drink coffee<br />-No one has ever tested this product on me!!<br />-I've had no problems with any kind of sickness or other unpleasant side effects from using this product.

Baby,"I'm very happy with this product.  It is a little smaller than I thought it would be, but still looks great! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the price.  The instructions were easy to follow: You'll need an internet browser or something like that. If you're looking for a quick and easy way to get your money's worth, look no further.",NON-GUIDED
Home Improvement,The product is very easy to install.  I have not had any problems with it so far.  My only complaint is that the installation instructions are a bit confusing.  It took me about an hour and 45 minutes to figure out how to set up my home repair kit.,GUIDED

I like the fact that I can charge my cell phone in less than an hour without having to worry about getting caught up in any kind of unplugging issue.  It doesn't take me much time to figure out how to hook up and use this device because it's super easy to set up (and not have to wait).",NON-GUIDED
Apparel,Already had a lot of compliments on this item. I am 5'3&#34; and weigh 205 lbs.  This is by far the best size for my 6'1&#34; 7'6&#34; build. The material is very soft and feels like it will last you a long time.,GUIDED
Luggage,"I've had this bag for a couple of years now, and it's still holding up well.  The only thing I don't like is that the straps are not long enough to be able to hold everything in one place. The strap itself is very nice looking (at least on my part), but you can't really tell if they're all made out of cardboard or something... It doesn't look as sturdy as some other bags we've carried over the years, but once you get used to them, your feet will start peeling off after about 3-4 months.  It took me awhile to figure out how to put these together, so I'm glad I did. Overall, definitely worth the money.",NON-GUIDED

It's the most visually stunning piece of gaming entertainment out there.  The graphics are crisp and clear - you can't go wrong with it.  You can play as many people as you want without feeling like you're in real life.  There isn't much else to say about this game that makes me smile or giggle at when someone tells me how awesome it is.

Video DVD,I a so happy I bought this one.  It is very easy to set up and the sound is great.  My only complaint is that it doesn't play well with my iPod touch.  You have to turn off the volume control in order to play DVDs or Blu-Ray discs.,GUIDED
Home Entertainment,"Generally speaking, video games tend to be very expensive.  This is because of the price difference between Sony and Microsoft.  However, I was pleasantly surprised at how well these two companies are able to combine a wide variety of game systems.

Both have been extremely successful in their respective titles.",NON-GUIDED

However, if you are upgrading from an older operating system to a newer one (i.e., Windows 7 or later), this may not be the case. I have been using my PC for several months now and am very happy with how well it has performed over the past few months.  The ability to seamlessly transfer files between multiple computers without having to rely on Microsoft’s built-in security features will allow me to easily transfer files between different computers without resorting to third parties.

I am 5'3&#34; and weigh 205 lbs., so this isn't an issue at all.  However, as far as sizing, I'm 6'2&#34; (205).

Musical Instruments,"What can I say about this product?  It's very simple to set up.  You will need a separate microphone for each instrument you use.  There is no built-in power source, so you have to hook it in with the supplied cable.  The unit comes with an adapter that plugs into your computer. The first step is to turn on/off the volume control (which takes some getting used to).  If you don't know how to do that, then there are three steps: 1) Turn off the volume control by pressing &#34;X&#34; at the bottom of the box and holding down until you press &#34;X&#34; as desired.

I like that it comes with instructions on how to use &#34;screws&#34; and how to set up your own screw driver.  There are so many different ways you can do these things without having to go through all the manual steps.  You will need an external screwdriver (a few dollars) or something similar in order to get the job done.  For example, if you don't have one at home, you may want to take some extra precaution before setting it up.

Musical Instruments,i've played them all over the world.,GUIDED

Lawn and Garden,"Effective product.  We use this for our garden hose, which is made of a plastic-like material.",GUIDED
Automotive,"For the price, this is a good product.  I have had no problems with it as of yet. Pros:<br />- Easy to install and operate<br />- Excellent battery life<br />- Plenty of torque<br />- A lot of torque<br />Cons:<br />- You do need to manually adjust the amount of torque you can put on the front axle in order to achieve maximum torque (i.e., max or min)<br />- It doesn't take up much room at all for your rear axle<br />- The wheels don't rotate very well so they will wobble quite a bit when fully inflated<br />- There are some minor side effects that may not be noticed by most auto repair folks but just happen to be an auto mechanic. Bottom Line:<br />I would definitely buy this again if needed.",NON-GUIDED
Jewelry,The product is exactly what I was looking for.  It arrived on time and the instructions were easy to follow.  My only complaint is that it does not come with a case so you have to carry it in your pocket or purse.,GUIDED

Shoes,"They are very well made.  I am 5'6&#34; and weigh 135 lbs.  The quality of the shoes is as good as it gets. The only thing that surprised me was how easy these boots were to get on my shoulders.  They fit a bit snug, but not too tight or too loose.  That said, they do have some room for improvement in their comfort level (I'm 6'3&#34;). Overall, if you are looking for a shoe that will last longer than most, then this is your chance.",NON-GUIDED

Tools,"It's been a long time since I bought it.  The quality of the product is very good, and if you are looking for something that will last forever, then look no further. I have not had any problems with this item as far as durability.  It seems to be made in China so there may be some rust or corrosion on the parts which could lead to rust over time.  This one was well worth the investment.",NON-GUIDED
Jewelry,"When I first saw this, I thought it would be a nice gift.  It is very simple to set up and put together.

Kitchen,"I bought this for my husband and he loves it.  It has a lot of room on the counter, so I don't have to worry about spills. It is very easy to set up but not too heavy at all.  The only thing that annoys me is how long it stays put in the sink.",NON-GUIDED

Wireless,"We've been using this for a couple of years now and it seems to be working great. The only thing I don't like about the wireless charging is that you have to plug in some kind of power source on your phone, so if you're going to use an external power source (which isn't what we did before), then there's no need to worry about wires getting lost or anything. So far its working fine! I'm still trying to figure out how to hook up my Samsung Galaxy S5 with ethernet cable via USB instead of wired.",NON-GUIDED

Luggage,"When I first got this, it was a little bit bulky.  However, once you put it in the back of your car seat, it is very comfortable to carry. The only complaint I have with luggage carriers is that they do not allow people to use their hands while on the go.  This has been an issue for me since I bought it and when I returned it, my hands were still too far away from where I wanted them to be.. So if you are looking for a bag that can hold all kinds of items, then this might be the bag for you.",NON-GUIDED

Video Games,"What's next? This is the first video game I've ever owned. I have no idea what it will be like for me to play games on my computer.  It doesn't really matter how many hours a day or two you can put together and build your own world based on this little guy. There are so many things going on in this video game, but one of them is that there are so many different ways to make something awesome.  The goal here is to create something that has not been done before (or even if it hasn't been done before).  There are so many other options out there...there are so many more possibilities! So let's start off by saying that I'm very satisfied with this game.  If you're looking for something that does not take up too much space at all, then this isn't it.",NON-GUIDED

Baby,"Generally speaking, I don't know if it's a good product or not.  However, for some reason they didn't seem to be able to hold up very well in the morning and evening. I have been using these since my 6 month old was born.  We've had no problems with them so far! They are easy to put on and clean (they're soft) which is great because you can easily get rid of all that messiness by washing your hands after each wash.  They also stay away from dust when putting baby clothes back into their diapers.  The only thing I would like to see change is how much water they take out of babies' mouths during diaper break-ins.  This isn't an issue at all but we'll see how this holds up over time.",NON-GUIDED
Apparel,Just what I was looking for.  This is a nice size and fits my needs very well.  The material is soft and the colors are not too harsh or anything like that.,NON-GUIDED
Home,"Have a hard time finding something that will work for you.  I bought this to use in my kitchen. It does what it's supposed to do, and is easy to set up.  You just have to go into the Setup section of the home computer/sceptre (or whatever). There are two options:<br />1) There is no built-in timer;<br />2) It doesn't let you know when your food has been turned on or off by any means other than an internet connection. If you don't want to be able to keep track of which meal you've been eating, then this may not be the way to go. The only thing I would like to add is that if you haven't used all of the features mentioned above, you'll find yourself having trouble figuring out how to make sure things work correctly.",NON-GUIDED

Shoes,"While the description says it's made in China, I'm not sure if that's true or not.  It arrived on time and was packaged very well.  My only complaint is that there are a few pockets inside of the shoe which you can't really see through without taking your eyes open.",NON-GUIDED

Built in remote control<br />3. Remote control works well<br />Cons<br />1. You have to go through several steps before your DVD starts playing and turning on/off (which took me about an hour)<br />2. If you want to play DVDs or Blu-Ray discs they are not as easy as some DVD players but if you're just trying to get them to start playing then there's no problem.",NON-GUIDED

The only thing i don't like about the color is there are no words to describe what you're looking for in your home or anywhere else! It also comes with an earring, which can be used as a garnet if you want to decorate any room without being too big (or too small!). This item came pre-purchased from amazon but has since been replaced by another seller who said they were going to send it back after 10 days due to their poor customer service.

If you don't know what's inside or out of the box, just open the &#34;clamp&#34; (or something like that). The assembly instructions were simple enough but after reading some of the reviews, I decided to go ahead and buy another one for myself.

It's easy to set up, plays well with no problems at all.  The only complaint I have is that you can't turn on/off the tuner when switching between different types of music.  That may be due to the fact that many people don't know what you're listening to or not having enough time to figure out how to switch between different genres of music.  For example, if you want to start off by saying ""muddy"" (which isn't an issue) then go ahead and listen to your favorite song while playing &#34;Muddy"".",NON-GUIDED

It has tons of plot twists and there are plenty of plot threads (and some dialog).  There are so many different ways you can go from one character to another... You will never be able to figure out how to get your heart rate up or down without having read the rest of the story.

First of all, let me start with the first thing you need to know: 1) You are going to have to unplug your PC and plug in an ethernet cable (or something like that).  This will take some getting used to... 2) The power supply needs to be turned on at least 1/4&#34; from the USB 3.0 port.  That's about as long as one can go!  If you don't want to use any kind of external power source, or if you just want to spend more time trying to figure out how to make sure everything is wired correctly, then this won't work for you.

Cons:<br />1) The plastic handle does not hold much weight but can easily be removed if you do not want to put everything together correctly. 4) If you are trying to glue things together before putting them together just make sure they aren't cut into small pieces which makes it difficult to pull apart after only a few minutes.",NON-GUIDED

The first one arrived on time and was a bit too big to wear (about 3 months ago), but that's okay. These shoes are very comfortable and look like they're going to last quite a while.  They've held up pretty well over the past few years as far as comfort; however, there have been some issues with their durability.  For instance, once you put them under your feet after wearing them, they tend to get scratched or scrapes all over-the-ear.  That may not be an issue at all, but if you keep putting them under your back, they won't rust off any longer.  But then again, I haven't had any problems with this style of shoe--it hasn't happened yet.",NON-GUIDED

Musical Instruments,"This is a great guitar for beginners.  It's very easy to set up, and it has plenty of room for the tuners. I've used several different types of instruments in my career that I have had no problems with.  For example, if you're looking for an acoustic instrument that can be played as a solo or as a solo, this may not be the case! There are many kinds of instruments out there that will make your life so much easier (e.g. Bass, Eureka, etc).  However, most of them aren't designed specifically for playing any kind of music at all - they just do what they are supposed to do.  There are also tons of other types of instruments that don't even remotely compare to these type of instruments.  The biggest difference between these types of instruments is how quickly each note comes across on the fretboard.",NON-GUIDED

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that you have to go through several steps before installation.  There are no instructions on how to adjust the speed of the pull-off (included).  You will need an external power source or something like that which can be plugged into the wall outlet as well.  The first step is to turn off the automatic stopwatch if necessary.

Camera,"Firstly, I bought this to use with my Nikon D3200.  It works great and is very easy to set up. The first thing I noticed about the camera was that it took a few minutes to get started but then you have to do some background checks before you can take any pictures. I don't know why anyone would want to pay $20 for something like this... It's cheaper than buying an SD card or Blu-ray player on Amazon (if you are willing to go through all the hassle of going through multiple checklists).",NON-GUIDED

The only thing i don't like is how long it will last but once you get used to it may be as long as 3 months or longer depending on where you put your wrist in it.  On the other hand, if you are going to spend more time trying to find a new one then this probably won't hold up well at all.

Electronics,"First of all, I wanted to say that this is a very good product.  It has some pretty cool features. Firstly, it allows you to adjust the power source for your system and can also adjust the volume/output depending on how much you want it to be.  For example, if you are using an outlet with a USB 3.0 port (i.e. plugging in 2 or more ports) then there is no need to use any kind of external power source at all.  This will allow you to adjust the output without having to worry about wires getting caught up in the middle. The second feature is easy to set up.

You will need an 18&#34; drill bit or something like that.  If you don't know what's on the inside of your tool (for example if you want to make sure everything doesn't fall out), then there is a hole in the top of the drill bit which makes it difficult to get through without putting anything else into the box.

There are no preamps, you have to be careful not to overpunch on your strings at all.  You can adjust the amount of gain or treble depending on which type of instrument you play.

As far as diapers go, there are so many things you can't really figure out if these will hold up very well or not.  For example, while my son has been using his own BabyAid (baby-friendly), he still hasn't had any issues with cramps on him due to having too much air in his diaper.

Home Entertainment,"I bought this for my husband and he loves it.  It has a lot of room to put his games on, so I don't have much room in the living room as we all do.  The only thing that stood out was how easy it is to set up. The controls are pretty straight forward, but you can adjust the amount of movement by turning the left or right buttons depending on your preference.  You can also change the brightness/darkness of the light from 0-10% to -20%.  If you want to turn off the lights at certain times (for example if you're going to play music while driving) then there's no option to turn them off.  This would be great if you wanted to make sure they didn't interfere with other things such as changing the color of the night sky...",NON-GUIDED

I am 6'1&#34; and weigh 205 pounds but she has yet to get used to being skinny enough to fit in jeans or t-shirts.  The sizing chart is very easy to follow as you can see how well she will be able to move around without hurting herself.  For me, though, this isn't going to hurt anyone at all.  It's going to help with weight loss if she continues to lose more room than she normally does.",NON-GUIDED

You'll need an external hard drive or something like that. I've had no problems installing any of these on my Prius at all.  They don't take up too much space in your car when you're driving because they tend to get clogged by things (like tire pressure). The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is due to the fact that there aren't many options available for manual transmission.  For example, if you want to make quick turn signals without having to worry about brake lights coming off after each turn, go ahead and buy another brand.",NON-GUIDED

It doesn't work if you forget to turn off the remote control by turning on the power button at the top of the screen. If you do not want to use the remote control feature, simply press the key (or ""OK""). 3.

It's easy to set up (easy on his wrist) and takes him about 10 minutes to set up.  It does take some getting used to but once you get used to it all starts to come in handy.

They're not too big or too small, but you don't have to worry about them falling off at any point if you want your dog to sit on it.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was due to the fact that there were no instructions on how to remove the top part (which would have been helpful since we'd never used an actual piece of furniture before!). The one thing I like most about these things is their ability to move around without having to use anything other than a metal clipper.

I have had plenty of lawn mowers over the past few years (and some still are), but it hasn't gotten any better in terms of quality or longevity.  The main thing I love about this one is how easy it is to set up.  You're not going to be having to do anything with an old lawn mower for hours every day at a time until you figure out how to set it up.  That being said, if you don't know how to set it up, then no matter how many times you turn it on, your lawn will start falling apart.",NON-GUIDED

For example, if you're going to go with browns or yellows, these could be great! I'm not an expert on interior design, so I didn't have much experience with interior design at all.

This is one of the better games out there on the market right now.  You can't beat the price at $20 or more when compared to other video games (like Battlefield, World of Tanks, Mass Effect 3, etc.).

The only reason I didn't give it four stars is because you'll want to play every single one of the missions (as opposed to five).  That being said, I was pleasantly surprised when I first played both Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 and Black Ops 4.",NON-GUIDED

Watches,"After a few months of use I decided to get one for myself.  This watch is very well made and looks like it will last many years.  The only complaint I have is that the strap on the back side doesn't come off, so if you don't wear it with your eyes open or close enough they won't stay closed.",NON-GUIDED

It fits me perfectly in the back of my car, so it's nice to be able to carry with me wherever I want.

It is easy to set up, we have a lot of tools in the house so if you need something that will be able to hold things like an umbrella or some sort of small piece of furniture on your back porch then I would recommend this. It does what it says it should do The only thing i don't like most about this product is its very simple to set up.

You can just go into the Setup section and type in &#34;Home Improvement&#34; (or any other language).",NON-GUIDED

It does what it's supposed to do and doesn't take up too much space.  If you're looking for something that can be played anywhere in the world without having to worry about getting ripped off by other disc players, this is one of those things... It comes with 2 USB 3.0 ports which allow you to plug in as many discs as you want (up to 32GB).  The only thing I don't like about this is that there isn't any external audio output so if you need some extra power, you may want to look elsewhere.",NON-GUIDED

The only thing I can say is that the instructions are not easy to follow so you'll have to figure out how to use them. First off, if you don't know how to place your utensils on top of each other in order to make sure they're lined up correctly (which isn't what I was looking for).  If there's one or two different utensils then mine are supposed to be placed right next to each other at the same time.  This makes sense since we need to put all our utensils together by hand before putting everything together.  There are about 1/8&#34; of utensils left over but most of them aren't large enough to hold as many utensils as possible.",NON-GUIDED

The only thing that bothered me was the size of the holes in the back of the case.

For example, on my last Gibson Les Paul E-B0007 (I bought them for Christmas), there were only two options: 1) The E-B0007 comes with an e-mail attachment which will allow you to send &#34;email protected&#34; from your home server or other electronic device. 2) You can also email me any questions in the comments section at http://www.amazon.",NON-GUIDED

The only thing I would say is that if you wear an expensive piece of clothing (for example jeans or t-shirts), it will be difficult to get your hands dirty before wearing them.

The straps are very comfortable, as long as you have one zippered pocket inside each zipper compartment.  It also has two zippered pockets (to keep things from slipping out).  There's an additional zippered pocket at the top where you can put your items if needed.

This is by far my favorite video game with replay value.  The graphics are just gorgeous and look like real personae from Resident Evil 4.

The only thing that bothered me was how long we were able to manually adjust the height of our cabinets without having to do so would be when we needed them. It also has some nice features such as:<br />- You can turn on/off switch from left or right depending on where you are in the house (i.e., if you want to change the position of the cabinet)<br />- You can choose between 2 different types of switches which will allow you to customize the way your cabinets look while still keeping the most modern look.",NON-GUIDED

The first one came with an 802.11b/g modems that were supposed to work but couldn't. The second one didn't work as well as the first one did.

But overall, if you're looking for better wireless networking, look no further.",NON-GUIDED

Video Games,"Often times when I am in the business of video games, I need to make a decision on whether or not to purchase this game.  This review is for those who are interested in learning more about Call of Duty: Black Ops II. I have read some other reviews that say it doesn't really matter what type of game you buy and play.  For instance, one reviewer said there was an ""unsatisfaction"" with the amount of money spent on this game.  That's because many people don't know exactly how much they spend (or even if they do). However, as someone who has been playing Call of Duty for years, I decided to give this game a try.  The first thing I did was go ahead and order this game.  It took me about 20 minutes to arrive from my hotel room where I had already ordered two copies of Call of Duty: Black Ops II.",NON-GUIDED

The gameplay is very similar to previous Call of Duty titles such as Call of Duty: Black Ops II or Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3.  The graphics are much better than previous Call of Duty games but still feel like they were made from scratch.  You have to go through multiple levels to get access to each level.

For example, if you want an ornamental staircase or anything like that, look no further than this one.  This one has all the bells and whistles but does not have any bells and whistles.

Video Games,"If you are looking for a video game controller, this is it.  You can play as many games as you want without having to worry about the controllers falling off. The reason I bought this is because of the low price and lack of features.  This controller does not have any buttons or controls at all.  It comes with an external hard drive (a USB stick) that will allow you to transfer files from one computer to another in order to work on other computers.  There is no built-in mouse/keyboard support.  The only thing I would say is that if you are going to make your life easier by playing more games then this won't even be compatible with my Wii U!

Automotive,"No complaints here.  This is exactly what I was looking for. I have been using it a little over a year now, and the first time I saw it on Amazon, I decided to give it a try! It's easy to put together, but you can't really do that with any of the tools available at this price range.  There are so many different kinds of tools out there, each has their own set of tools (tools included).  It takes some getting used to, but if you're an auto mechanic or something like that, don't be afraid to use one. The main thing I love about this tool is its ability to turn your front passenger side window into a full screen view.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it doesn't have all the features other car manufacturers offer in the same package.",NON-GUIDED

That being said, it does take some practice to figure out how to deal with someone who doesn't know all the details beforehand.  However, once you get your hands on one of these items, you can definitely start from the beginning.  This book gives you an idea of just how to deal with someone who isn't even close to you.

I have one of these in my Jeep Wrangler Unlimited which is about 3/5"" longer than any other vehicle on our road.  The only thing i don't want to do is make sure your headlights are on the side so they aren't bumped or scratched when driving at full speed.  This does not prevent me from being able to drive straight ahead without having to rely on front tire pressure sensors (which may be annoying if you know what's causing the problem).",NON-GUIDED

It didn't seem like much at first, but after playing with it for a few weeks, I was able to figure out how to use it without having to worry about any major equipment malfunctions.  After some practice, I'm sure there will be no issues whatsoever! I'd also like to point out that if you own an MP3 player (for example, mp3 players), you may want to take care of your MP3 player by yourself.

It's just not what you'd expect from an entertainment video DVD, especially if you don't have any interest in learning more about some of the lesser known classics.  If you like these movies as much as you do, they will make your life better by watching them at least once every few months.

It doesn't take up too much space in the back of the bag so there is a lot of room inside if you have not used it before! 3. The only thing i would say is that when opening the diaper bag (which can be hard to open and close with all the tools/tools being removed from the bag) its very small compared to most other bags but still big enough to hold about 20&#34; diapers. 4. You will probably want to put some extra padding around the top of the bag as well...this adds another layer of protection without having to worry about anything falling off or anything else like that. 5.",NON-GUIDED

This makes them easy to put together without having to remove the glue. 3) You don't have to worry about how long they will last but once you've finished putting everything together, just be careful not to let your fingers get stuck in the drawers or any other part of the drawers (such as cabinets, bathrooms, etc.). 4) They come pre-drilled with 1/4 cup plastic wrap wrapped around the sides for storage.",NON-GUIDED

Pros:<br />Cons:<br />1) You get what you pay for, 2) It's easy to read your license plate number, 3) The only thing that annoys me most about this is how many times my license plate numbers are displayed on the dash (or other side of the screen).<br />4) There isn't much in-line reading/reading instructions at all!<br />5) If you want to keep track of your license plate number, 5) Your license plate number can be turned off if you're driving under the influence.",NON-GUIDED

If you are looking for an inexpensive DVD or Blu-ray player that will last your whole life, here are my impressions: 1. It's very easy to install. 2. You just have to go into the Setup menu (where you can select &#34;Software Update&#34;) and download the software from http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LQIYE/ref=oh_aui_support_details?ie=UTF8&psc=1 3.

The second game in the series, Call of Duty: Black Ops IV, had some really bad games but they were all great.  It took me awhile to figure out how to properly use both Call of Duty: Black Ops V and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare on their respective systems.  For those who are not familiar with Call of Duty: World War II (or WWII) then you should probably have read the previous reviews before buying this game.

It's very simple to setup which will let you know what your video needs to be played via blu-ray/iPad.<br />4. You'll need an external hard drive in order to play discs from this player but if you're not familiar with how to use these players, they won't take too long to get used to them.<br />5.

It's always been hard to find a factory-level automotive with lots of bells and whistles built into it...but now I can tell you one thing: 1. There are so many different types of engines available in all kinds of cars - from turbochargers (turbines) to superchargers (plans).  Each has its own set of exhaust pipes which makes them very easy to use.  For example, if you're going to make your garage full of gas, there are plenty of small diesel engines on the market too. 2.

It takes up so much space when you're reading them.  If you don't have time to spare, or if you just want to learn more, then these books won't hold up as long as they used to be.

There are several mini-dvd players out there on the market so don't waste your money! My only complaint about this player is its lack of features.

Pros:<br />- Easy to adjust settings<br />- Plenty of torque<br />- Smooth ride with moderate compression<br />- Solid build quality<br />- Excellent price Cons:<br />- You have to be careful when starting from the front wheel if you're going to slow down on your motorcycle (i.e., start off slow).

I was surprised at how little difference in audio quality compared to other players out there (i.e., Sony or Panasonic).  However, if you are looking for a sound system capable of playing discs faster than others, this may not be the case.

There are plenty of small appliances that can be used as cooking utensils (for example).  The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars was because there were no instructions on how to turn it on/off when not in use.

Adjusts both sides of the car to make sure there aren't too many clasps or dislodges between the battery and the front passenger side seat. 3.

You have to go through dozens of levels to get access to those levels.  There aren't enough levels to make up for these problems.  If you're lucky enough to be able to play both Mass Effect 3 and Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 on Xbox One, then if you're lucky enough to be able to do both, then Halo 4 isn't your cup of tea.

There is a timer for each hour that will tell you how many hours have passed since your last use. 4. The unit has an indicator at the top which tells you how much time you want to be able to put in, so if you don't have any more than one hour left then there is a countdown timer option available. 5.

Shoes,"Our daughter loves them.  They are easy to put together, and the quality is great. The only thing I don't like about these shoes is that they have a small zipper on either side of the shoe so you can pull it off if you want to keep your hands from sliding around while wearing them.  The zippers do not fit in my hand or neck (which makes me feel less secure).",NON-GUIDED
Baby,"Wasn't exactly what I was looking for.  It's a little bit large, but it fits nicely in my lap. I'm 5'3&#34; and weigh 205 lbs., so if you're taller than me, this is the way to go! The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because there are no instructions on how to set it up or how to turn it on/off.  You'll need an internet browser (if you don't have that) before you can set it up.  There aren't any instructions as to how to use it...but they do say ""on/off"".  If you haven't used it yet, let me know via email if your expecting baby will find it helpful.",NON-GUIDED

Books,"What's new about this book is that it tells the story of a young man and how he overcame adversity to become a successful writer.  It was written in such a way that I can't speak for myself. I have read many books before, including The Art of Pablo Piccoli (1984) and Little Red Riding Hood (1990), but never had any real impact on my life as a teenager.  That said, there are plenty of good books out there that will make you want to read more or less all at once.",NON-GUIDED
Video DVD,"Great Blu-ray player for the price.  The sound is great, but it's not as good as some other players.

If you've only ever used blu-ray discs, there's no way you can do anything about it right now.",NON-GUIDED

If you're going to play music anywhere from 50mW into an entire room at night, these may be just what you need most.",NON-GUIDED

You will need to manually turn off the power button if you want to play DVDs or Blu-Ray discs. If you don't know how to turn off the power button after doing so, then why bother?

Bottom Line:<br />If you're looking for an inexpensive way to put things together without having to worry about them falling apart, this may not be the case.",NON-GUIDED

The buttons are easy to set up (right click menu) and take a picture of your TV.  My only complaint is that there aren't any instructions on how to turn off the power button so you'll have to go through some manual troubleshooting steps before using them. The sound is great!

If you're looking for something like an action-adventure game (which isn't much of a stretch), then this is your chance.  If you're looking for something like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, then this is what you'll be looking for.  The gameplay is very similar to those of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3; however, they have some similarities.

I've used several different types of lights in my house, and this one has worked great.  There are two main ways you can use them: 1) Hold down the light for about an hour or so before putting it on your furniture (as long as you don't put too much pressure on the bulb).  You will be able to adjust the amount of light each way depending on where you want it to go. 2) Adjust the brightness level by adjusting the intensity from 0-20%.  In other words, if you need more than 20% of the light per second, then 5% of the light per second would be turned off.",NON-GUIDED

Video Games,"Sometimes they don't come up with a good story line. I've been playing video games for about 10 years now and this one has it all.  The graphics are great, the dialogue is very clear, and there isn't much to talk about.  I'm not sure if that's because some of the voice actors have bad taste in their movies or just plain terrible acting.  That may be due to how many times you see an elderly man walking into a group of people trying to get out of his car while he's been pulled over by a police officer... The only thing I can say is that as far as characters development goes, none of them really make any sense at all.",NON-GUIDED

Health & Personal Care,"What's the point of this product? I bought it for my husband and he is very happy with it. He has noticed a difference in his sleep patterns over the past few months. So far, I have not had any adverse side effects from this product. The one thing I would like to add is that if you are having trouble sleeping during the night, your body will begin to produce an increased amount of CO 2 (which may be due to decreased blood pressure) which can lead to more cramps on your hands and joints. However, once you get used to using these products, they do tend to take some getting used to but don't seem to affect your mood or heart rate.  Also, there seems to be no change in skin tone at all!

It does not take up too much space or too much room at all.  You can just plug it into your wall outlet without having to use any additional power outlets.

The author has an excellent message for anyone who wants to learn more about fairy tale characters.  It's easy to follow but also very informative.  You will not be able to figure out all the details of each character until you do so.  If you can figure it out or don't know how to use it, just make sure you're familiar with the story first.

This book has been around for quite some time now with lots of great reviews from people like myself who haven't had any problems playing classical music at all.  My only complaint is that there isn't much else to say except for the fact that most of the songs written about Classical music actually end up being played over and over again.",NON-GUIDED

It took me a couple of minutes to figure out what was needed in order to put it together.  The directions were pretty straight forward: 1. Make sure not to use any tools other than screws or chain saws.  You will be able to assemble your own screwdriver without having to worry about getting messy. 2. If you want to do anything else (like cutting grass), make sure everything is clean-up by hand!

Home Entertainment,"It's been a long time since I bought this game, so I decided to give it a try. First of all, let me start off by saying that there are many things you can do to improve your gameplay.  First and foremost, make sure you have the basics in mind before jumping into any multiplayer mode.  You will not be able to play as many games as you normally do (i.e., Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2).  Second, keep in mind that if you don't know how to level up or just want to go out onto the open world, then you won't even be able to unlock certain levels.

If you're looking for an easy-to-use way to keep your purses organized while shopping, here's my advice: 1) Make sure each purse has a zippered pocket on either side (not included).  The zippers can be tucked away or folded up into smaller pockets if necessary.  For example, if you want to carry a backpack full of clothes, make sure not to overstuff them with too much paper. 2) Don't use any type of packing tape at all.  You will need some kind of elastic band to secure the velcro straps in place so they won't fall off when traveling.",NON-GUIDED

It is easy to set up and operate without having to worry about battery issues or anything else going on in the house.  The only thing preventing me from doing that is getting rid of my phone's screen protector by turning off the power button.  If you are looking for a simple way to get rid of your phone's screen protector, here are some suggestions: 1) Turn off the power button after every turn (or if you don't want to do so).  This will not let you know when there is an issue while you are still active.  You can then be sure to turn off the power button at any point during the day/even hours following the instructions.",NON-GUIDED

However, there are times when you just need to go into the car every time you want to pull over or if your child is moving around trying to move around...it takes me about half an hour to get out of the car!

I've had no problems with this player as far as sound quality and audio quality.

The first thing you do is make sure your fingers are in the correct position (the &#34;keyboard&#34;).  You can adjust the length of the string depending on which one you use.

If you do not want to use any kind of pressure cookware or utensils as some others say they don't work well for most types of cooking.

The only thing that annoyed me was the fact that you have to be careful not to mess things up with any kind of screwdriver.  If you don't want to mess things up by accident or something like that, then there is no way for you to mess things up! I would highly recommend this product.",NON-GUIDED

The only thing I would like to add is that the back cover has a little bit of plastic backing so you don't have to worry about getting scratched or anything.  It was easy to put together, we were able to assemble it just in time for him to take it apart.  We will be ordering another one as soon as they are completed.",NON-GUIDED

I am not going to go into too much detail about the sizing, but if you are looking for something that will fit in your waist size, then look no further.  It fits well on her larger than average sized man so far.  The material is very soft and supple.  You can wear it all day without being bothered by any of the scuffs or peeling marks.  My only complaint is that some of the seams around the seam make it difficult to get past them.  That may be due to the fact that most of the fabric is made from recycled materials (such as cardboard).  However, once you have finished putting it together, don't expect it to hold up at all.",NON-GUIDED

I love the fact that there is a lot of room in the pot when we are all on the move.  It's easy to put together with no effort at all! It takes me about an hour to get everything done.  The instructions aren't as detailed as you would think but they are very helpful if you have kids or just want to make sure your child doesn't mess around too much during the process. The only thing I didn't like was how hard it was to open the pot before putting it into the pot.  This allowed him to easily access the pot without spilling any liquid out.  There were some small pieces left over after each use (like water bottles).",NON-GUIDED

My only complaint with this item is that it doesn't have a lot of pockets, so you can easily fill them all up without having to go through too much hassle.  If you don't want to carry large items like jewelry or other things at the same time, just be careful not to over pack everything into your pocket.",NON-GUIDED
Automotive,"We've had this for about a year now.  It's been very easy to install and operate without any issues. The only thing I didn't like was the lack of instructions on how to turn it on/off, which is nice since you don't have to do that yourself.  The directions are hard to read at first because they say ""ON"" or ""OFF"".  However, once you're done with manual operation, there may be some confusion as to whether your car will automatically turn off when turning on/off.  If so, let's talk about an auto-off switch...

If you are looking for something that will entertain and entertain your family while watching movies or playing video games, this is the place to start. I am not going to go into too much detail about how it functions but I will say that it does what it's supposed to do.  It lets you set up as many devices as you want without having to worry about wireless interference.  That said, if you're looking for something that won't interfere with any other device (e.g. an MP3 player) then this may be the way to go.

Shoes,"Seriously, this is the worst shoe I've ever worn.  It's so cheap that it really makes me feel like I'm in debt to a bunch of people who don't wear them all the time. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because there were no reviews on how well it would hold up at first (I had an issue with my size 7) but after wearing it for a few hours and being able to walk around without any problems, I couldn't be happier!

I love how easy it is to put together &#34;make&#34; in minutes! The instructions are as follows: 1. Make sure you have pre-drilled nails before putting them into the box. You will need an electric drill or something like that. If you do not want to use your own hand drill (or any other tool at all), make sure there is a small screw on the end of the drill so that both sides can go together without damaging the pieces. 2.

It looks like it will be interesting to see how well it develops over time.  However, for now, let's take a look at some of the differences: 1. The Prius is much more compact than any other vehicle I've ever owned. 2. While the Prius is heavier than most sedans, it doesn't have that big head-mounted display. 3. Despite being slightly larger (about 5.5&#34;) than its competitors, it still has plenty of room on the floor for additional storage. 4.",NON-GUIDED

You will need an internet connection at least 2-3 times per day which may not be ideal if you don't have multiple computers connected simultaneously.

It also has an adjustable strap that allows you to adjust the height of your arms or legs, which can be adjusted depending on the length of your arm or leg.

Furniture,"We bought this for our son and he loves it.  It is a very well made piece of furniture, easy to assemble and the price was just right. The only complaint I have is that there is not enough room in the back on the stand so you can't see or hear your voice.  We had been able to put together two sets of chairs (the one we purchased as a Christmas gift) with no problems at all.  The first set consisted of four chairs but they didn't seem to hold up much.  There were some minor issues with the drawers being difficult to move around due to the height of the chairs.  They also did not allow us to adjust the height of the chairs without putting too much pressure on the drawers.  So far so good! I would highly recommend this item.",NON-GUIDED
Video Games,"Meets Game Boy Advance.  The first video game I've ever seen was Call of Duty: Black Ops II.  It took me a while to figure out how to play it, so I decided on this one. The gameplay is very similar to the previous games in terms of graphics and sound.  There are many different ways you can customize your character based on what you like or dislike.  For example, if you want to go along with an assassin, for example, that's pretty much all you have to do is jump from one side to the other.  This allows you to choose between killing enemies (or at least getting killed) as well as allowing you to change outfits depending on where you see them. There are also some cool features such as unlockable skins which allow you to customize your character based on who you think you're going to be playing next time.",NON-GUIDED

Tools,"Before I could write this review, let me first say a few things. First of all, it's important to note that these are made in China (not the U.S.) so you can't get them anywhere near your home. 1) They're pretty darn cheap! 2) You don't even have to worry about how long they'll last if you buy something else.  The price is actually cheaper than any electronics store out there on the market.  This one costs around US$20-25 dollars and comes with 2 extra screws for each screw slot.  It also comes with two different types of batteries which allow you to charge more quickly without having to worry about getting burned or anything like that. 3) These aren't as big as some of the other &#34;aluminum&#34; guys out there at Wal-Mart.",NON-GUIDED

Furniture,We really loved this item.,GUIDED
Electronics,"Excellent product.  I have been using this for a couple of years now and it works great!  My only complaint is that the speakers are not adjustable so you can't adjust them to your liking.  This may be due to the fact that they don't come with an extension cord, or something like that.  However, if you're looking for a portable sound bar (or some kind of stand), look no further than this one.",NON-GUIDED

Furniture,This is a great addition to our family room.  It's easy to put together and the quality is very good.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars instead of 6 is because there are so many different types of furniture that you will not be able to use them all.,GUIDED
Toys,Knife works great. Cuts very well and holds all of the tools I need to use it.,GUIDED
PC,"Here's my review: 1.  I like the fact that it comes with a variety of chargers. 2.  This charger is very easy to set up and works well for those who are just getting used to charging their phones. 3.  You can charge your phone via USB, which means you can plug in any kind of external device (iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch). 4.  It takes about an hour from me to get all the chargers out there. 5.  The power button appears to be on the bottom of the charger so if you don't have enough power then this will not work. 6.",NON-GUIDED

Video DVD,"As a whole, I have not had any problems with this product.  However, it is very easy to install and operate. The installation instructions are pretty straightforward: 1) Install the software as shown in the video above (click on &#34;Software Update&#34;). 2) Once installed, you will need an internet connection from your computer that can be used for streaming DVDs or Blu-Ray discs.  If you don't want to go through all the hoops of installing/modifying these steps, make sure you know how to do them first before attempting those steps.  You should then use the internet connection provided by Amazon's customer service center at your local hardware store where you can stream DVDs or Blu-Ray discs directly into the home network.

Then use one hand to cut through each piece so as not to break down any smaller pieces. 3) Using a sharpener such as Sharpie Saw or Gerber K-Pistol instead of Sharpie Saw may seem like an overkill if you aren't careful enough to get what you're looking for.

One has an Olympus M4S-C3D (the same as the Nikon 85mm f/2.8) and the other uses Canon's A5SLR digital SLR. The first one took only 30 seconds or less than 2 minutes depending on where you were going in the picture. The second one took more than 45 seconds or less than 3 minutes depending on where you were going in the picture. Both cameras are rated at 5 megapixels which means they can take very good photos without interference from your DSLR.",NON-GUIDED

Musical Instruments,"I'll start by saying that this is a very good instrument for beginners.  It's easy to set up, but you have to be able to adjust the tone in order to use it.  The main thing I like most about this instrument is its simplicity.  There are no built-in controls and there aren't any manual functions available. You can do some basic tuning without having to go through all of the &#34;setting up&#34; steps.  That said, if you don't know how to turn on/off the tuner, then you might as well just plug your finger into one of those little ""guitars"".

PC,"I'd say it's a good product.  I've had no problems with this unit, but that doesn't seem to bother me at all. Pros:<br />Cons:<br />- The buttons are not as intuitive as the ones shown in the picture and they don't hold up very well (other than that)<br />- You have to scroll through menus if you want them to stay on<br />- Some of the buttons can be hard to find when searching for items like oil, diamonds, etc...<br />- There isn't an option to reset the battery status by pressing the power button or turning off the USB cable(i.e..it won't reset the battery).",NON-GUIDED

Office Products,I put this product on my computer and it worked great.  I have tried many different products but none of them are worth the money.,GUIDED
Automotive,"Firstly, I have to say that this is a good product.  The only complaint I have with it is that the black paint on the front of the engine does not stay in place very well at all.  If you are looking for a quick and easy way to clean up your car, then this may be the right choice.",NON-GUIDED
Office Products,"I wrote a review for this product.  I have had it for about 3 months now, and am very happy with the quality of the product.",GUIDED
Baby,"What's next for me? First of all, I want to share my experience with this product.  It is very easy to set up and use. I have been using it for about 3 months now without any problems.  The first thing I did was install the software on my phone via a USB stick.  This allowed me to plug into an external hard drive as soon as I plugged in the software.  Since that time has not happened, I haven't had any issues at all.  So far so good.  My only complaint is that if you are trying to unplug from your computer (or something like that) then there may be some sort of ‘unplugging problem’ occurring.  That being said, I do know that sometimes things get really hot when you try to unplug or unplug anything out of the box.",NON-GUIDED
Video DVD,"The Blu-ray player is great if you want to watch movies on the go.  You don't have to worry about getting lost in a movie, it's just what you need for your home theater system. If you are looking for a portable DVD player that can be played over and over again with ease, this may not be the player for you! Pros: Cons: 1.  Picture quality is poor compared to other players (i.e., Sony) 2.  The picture quality isn't as good as some of the other players I've looked at. 3.

Kitchen,Received unit was very easy to set up.  I have a large kitchen and it is well made.  You can adjust the height of the pan if you like.,GUIDED

Wireless,"Often times when the cable is not in use, I have to buy a new one.  This product works great for my Verizon FiOS 3G and 4G phones. Pros<br />- Easy to set up<br />- Charger can be charged anywhere from 5 - 10 minutes<br />- Bluetooth 2.",NON-GUIDED
Camera,"Generally speaking, this camera is very good.  I use it to take pictures with my Samsung S4 and a Canon Rebel T3. I've had no problems using the camera on my Galaxy Note 3 or iPhone 5s over the past few months.  The only thing that bothered me most was how fast the battery drain rate went from one charge to another.  This resulted in an occasional drop of about 2-3% of total battery life (about 1 hour). The biggest issue I have with this camera is that you can't really see any light at all during the day unless you're near certain parts of the world where your phone is constantly being charged.  That's not a big deal as long as you don't know what happens when there isn't enough light to go around to tell you which part of the screen is full.",NON-GUIDED

Sports,"Sometimes I get compliments on the quality of these shoes.  They are very comfortable and look like they will last for a long time. I wear them every day in my house, so it is important to know that this shoe is made from real materials rather than synthetic material.  The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is due to the fact that there is no &#34;printing&#34; on the sole which could lead to an allergic reaction.",NON-GUIDED

Luggage,"From time to time, I have had this luggage for a while now.  It's not as big or bulky as some of the other bags I've used.  However, it looks great and is easy to carry. The only complaint I have is that you can't see all the zippers on either side of the bag.  This makes it very difficult to get your hands dirty after each use.  If you are carrying heavy items like shoes, t-shirts, jewelry, etc., then this will be an issue.  Also, if you don't have enough space in the bag, there may be more zippers than you bargained for.",NON-GUIDED
Sports,only two problems: 1) The cable is not very long. 2) You have to unplug the cord and plug it in.,GUIDED

Kitchen,The centerpiece was a piece of junk.  I could not be more pleased with this item.  It is easy to assemble and the instructions are very well written.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars instead of 10 would be due to the length of the top part being too short.,GUIDED

It's been very easy to get her started playing with it so I was able to figure out how to use it. I've used several different types of toys over the years (tactical dolls), but none were as fun or engaging as these things are now.  The only complaint I have is that there seem to be more &#34;swords&#34; in them since they're all plastic-like pieces.  These aren't designed specifically for doll heads--they're just big enough to hang on top of each other.",NON-GUIDED

Home Entertainment,"Went for a very long time. I have been using this product since it was first released.  It is easy to set up, and works well with all kinds of devices that I am connected to.  My only complaint is the lack of power on my computer.  If you want an entertainment system that will last forever, then this may not be the case.  The Power button can be turned off by pressing the &#34;power&#34; button in order to turn it back on.  There are no instructions on how to activate or deactivate the device.",NON-GUIDED

Baby,"Letters were very easy to set up.  I have a 2 year old and she loves them so much that we bought one for her birthday.  She is in love with them as well. I was able to put together the first few sheets of paper towels (with instructions on how to do it).  They are great!  It's not too big or too small, but you don't have to worry about your baby getting wet at any point during the day.  We also added some extra linoleum towels before each sheet came out.  This helps us keep things warm while keeping our babies from having to deal with their own messy messes.  The other two sheets really helped us figure out how to use these towels after each sheet arrived.  So far they seem to be working just fine.  My 3 year old has yet to show any signs of dryness.",NON-GUIDED

Pros:<br />- Easy to set up<br />- Simple to follow instructions<br />- Complimentary website<br />- Excellent price<br />- Cons:<br />- Battery life seems to be very high<br />- It's not as long as some of the other features mentioned above, but that doesn't seem to bother me at all.

There are plenty of plot points that you can add to your reading list if you want to learn more about the characters in the series.",NON-GUIDED

When I tried to unplug the battery (which is what happens when you plug your phone into an external hard drive) in order to shut off the screen, there were no instructions as to whether or not to turn off the power button.

The instructions are hard to follow as they do not say how to turn it on or off but if you don't want to risk getting caught trying to use your hands too many times...you just need to go ahead and figure out how to turn it on/off (it will take some practice).",NON-GUIDED

Apparel,"Firstly, I love these boots. They are very comfortable and look like they will last a long time. I wear them every day for about an hour or so during the day without any issues with my feet. This is due to the fact that most of the time when I am walking around in circles (about 10-15 minutes per day) I do not see where this would be helpful if there was no movement on my feet. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't seem to bother me at all how often I walk around doing business as usual.

Shoes,"Firstly, they are a bit large.  I am 6'1&#34; and weigh 135 lbs. However, the sizing chart is not very flattering for my 5'3&#34; 7'5&#34; height.  This means that if you have an average sized person (i.e., someone taller than me), these shoes will probably be too small for most people.

Kitchen,"Avoidance is a book about how to avoid putting food in the sink.  I have no idea what it might be like to put food in the sink, so I decided to try this one out.  It's easy to set up and works just fine. The only thing that annoys me most about this product is its lack of instructions on how to do it.  If you don't know how to do it (or if your child doesn't know how to do it), then there are plenty of instructions for doing it... I've tried several different types of dishes over the years, but none seem to work as well as my other KitchenAid products.  This one has all the basics: 1) clean utensils; 2) pour water into each dish; &#34;breathing&#34; 3) rinse off thoroughly.  4) Drain everything before adding more water.",NON-GUIDED
Video DVD,"Firstly, let me start by saying that I love this movie. The story is a bit different than the one you see in The Hurt Locker. It's more of an action-adventure film and it has some interesting twists and turns to make it enjoyable for those who don't know anything about martial arts or martial arts at all. However, there are plenty of good reasons why: 1) There isn't much fighting going on either side of the screen (like many martial arts movies do). You have to be careful not to get caught up in any kind of physical fight with your body part knocked down. This allows you to avoid getting caught up in both sides of the screen but also prevents you from being able to move around very easily.",NON-GUIDED

Video Games,"Ok, I'm not a big fan of Call of Duty games. However, for the most part they've been very good in keeping things simple and easy to use. There are so many great video games out there that you can't quite figure them all out by themselves. For example, Halo 2 was one of those first-person shooters where you had to rely on your co-workers to solve puzzles while you were building an empire. That's why I decided to give this game a try: Call of Duty: World War II was such a hit when it came to console gaming. It wasn't until after WWII that I realized how much more difficult it really was to get done than ever before.

If you're looking for an easy way to play Mass Effect 3 without having to worry about installation, here's my recommendation: 1. Install via USB in order to activate the online multiplayer mode. You can do so by pressing &#34;X&#34; (or two keys) at the top of the menu. Then press &#34;X&#34; until you want to activate the online multiplayer mode. 2.

That being said, this book offers some insights into how we might be able to use our own psychic abilities to change the course of human affairs.",NON-GUIDED

That being said, there are plenty of people out there who just want something better for their son or daughter.  The quality isn't bad either... I'm not going to go into too much detail about how it actually works (however annoying it really is), but as far as my kids use it, they seem to like it more than anything else.

I am not an expert on Chinese furniture so I will only go as far as to compare them to other similar products or services.  However, if you're looking for something more contemporary look no matter what style they are made in, there are some good reasons to buy: 1) They come pre-purchased &#34;Made in China&#34; (in China), which isn't supposed to be such a big deal but doesn't really make much sense at all.

Video Games,"It's been a while since I got this game, but it still feels and plays well.  The gameplay is very similar to that of Call of Duty or Mass Effect 3, except there are so many different ways you can customize your character. Gameplay wise though, the graphics are pretty much identical to those of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (although they aren't as detailed). I'm not sure if anything has changed in terms of graphical quality over time, but for some reason Ubisoft seems to have gotten away with making their games more attention-getting than any other video game out there.  That being said, when I first started playing MWO on Xbox 360 back in 2009, I really didn't want to play MWO at all.

The first thing I like about this product is its ability to charge your phone or tablet via USB instead of plugging in an external hard drive.  This means you can't do anything else besides plugging in and shutting off any other device at all.  That being said, if you're looking for a way to charge your phone or tablet via USB without having to worry about getting caught up in some kind of arcane &#34;to-do&#34; process where something isn't going to be executed on top of everything else (e.g. Apple's iPhone/iPad).",NON-GUIDED

This device does exactly what its supposed to do: Connecting your phone to an external hard drive (i.e., via USB) will allow you to transfer files from one computer to another without having to worry about re-connecting them again.  You'll be able to transfer files between multiple computers simultaneously by plugging in some kind of optical cable which doesn't seem like much for me either.

I haven't had any issues with their longevity as far as how long they last but so far this has held up well.  The best part about buying from Amazon is that you get what you pay for (about $10).

There are several different types of video games out there on the market with varying degrees of success (e.g., BioShock Infinite, etc.). For example, Crytek has made an impressive range of titles over the past few years based primarily on their innovative multi-player shooter approach.  While Bioware's Mario Kart 8 may be some of the best platformers in the series overall, it also holds up well against Street Fighter V due to its unique gameplay.",NON-GUIDED

Video Games,"Arrived on time and I'm very happy with this game. It's a bit of a disappointment to have 2D games in the same box. The graphics are not as good or even better than what they were used to, but you can't really tell if it's because your character is an action figure or something like that. The only thing I didn't like was how long it would take for people to get their hands on the game. It took me about 15 minutes to get them all set up (I don't know why anyone would want to wait 30-45 minutes). Final Thoughts: This game is pretty darn awesome!

Luggage,"Meets its expectations.  I have a lot of luggage and this one is well made.  It has plenty of room for all the things that need to be packed into it.  The zippers hold up very well, so you don't have to worry about them falling off or anything.  There are two zippers on each side which make it easy to put together. The only thing i would say is that if you're going to carry something as small as a suitcase (like my wife's purse) then these will probably not fit in your bag.  That being said there aren't any zippered compartments out there that can accommodate more stuff than they should.  If you plan on carrying items like watches, books, etc., then these won't fit in your backpack.",NON-GUIDED

Jewelry,"Seriously, this is a very pretty piece of jewelry.  It's made to look like real diamonds and it looks just like real diamonds.  The only thing I don't like about it is that there are no instructions on how to turn it on or off.  If you're looking for an easy way to get the jeweler to do your nails properly, then this isn't it.  You'll have to go through several steps to get it set up. The first step is to install the screws at the top of the screw holes.  This will take some getting used to, but if you want to use any kind of nail cleaner (such as natural cleaners), be careful not to place too much more than 1/4&#34; in the middle of the screw hole.  Once installed, put all the screws back together into one small ball holder.  Then, make sure everything is exactly what you need.",NON-GUIDED

This may be due to the fact that most of the notes aren't quite what you would expect from an instrument such as a cello.

The first thing I did was add some extra screws in order to make sure everything worked properly.  This allowed me to use all three screws as they were all fairly straightened out at the same time.  These included 2 1/4&#34; screws on one end (the other two are 4 1/2&#34;).  In addition, we had plenty of spare parts which could easily be swapped out if needed.

First, let me start by stating that the &#34;Batteries&#34; are not what you would expect from a non-biodegradable battery. In my opinion, these batteries come in two sizes: 1/4&#34; and 2/8&#34; (for example, 3/8&#34;). If you're looking for an inexpensive way to charge your smart phone while camping, then this is probably the best choice.

The only thing I didn't like was how hard it was to get your hands dirty when putting it together.",NON-GUIDED

Camera,"Been working great with my Canon Rebel T1, so far I have not had any issues.  The only issue is that the lens cap on the back of the camera has a small hole in it which can be easily fixed.

I haven't had any issues whatsoever with the controls being turned on or off (at least not yet), but that hasn't stopped me from playing them quite a bit.  The only complaint I have is that they seem to slow down playback of certain video games when you first play them.

I have watched several videos on YouTube showing how to make your life so much easier by simply switching between Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare (Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3) and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 4.  This has been my favorite video game for years.  It's an incredible amount of fun with lots of replay value as well as tons of replay value.

Automotive,"Firstly, let me start by saying that I have not had any issues with this product.  It is very easy to install and operate without a hitch. The installation instructions are pretty straightforward: 1) Install the &#34;charger&#34; from the front of your vehicle (if you don't want to use it for extended periods), then plug in the power cord into the battery compartment at the rear of your vehicle if needed. This will take about an hour or so depending on how many hours you've been fully charged/discharged. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was due to the length of the cord between the car and the charger itself being slightly longer than my previous recommendation would be. However, once you get the hang of using it for extended periods, there's still plenty of space left over for other modifications such as adjusting valve timing, etc.",NON-GUIDED

I've watched quite a few movies over the years with some really interesting characters (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, etc.) The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there aren't many sequels or even Blu-ray versions available right now.

There are so many different ways you can assemble your furniture without any assembly involved.

The only thing preventing me from buying another one is if they are too busy trying to figure out how to use them (which isn't really a big deal), or if they just don't have enough energy to get their attention.

It's nice to be able to see where things are going when you don't have any tools left at home. I've used several different types of pans over the years but one that was more expensive than the other cost me about $20-$30 per pan.  This one did not hold as much water as the others which were made from natural ingredients such as garlic, paprika, chili peppers, etc.. The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars instead of 5 would be due to the lack of quality control on the inside of the pan.  That being said, if you need something like this make sure you know what you're doing before making your own pans (especially if you plan on using canned food).",NON-GUIDED

It also has great control over his head which allows him to move around much more easily.  The only complaint about this guitar is its bass.  There is some treble on the mids and mid strings but not all at the same time.  That may be due to the fact that there is no'sweet spot' for these types of pickups.  However, you will need to adjust your treble settings depending on how well you use those settings.",NON-GUIDED

Pros:<br />- Easy to set up<br />- Great price<br />- Solid construction<br />- You get what you pay for!<br />- Excellent battery life<br />- Features are just as described<br />- Camera can be found at http://www.amazon.",NON-GUIDED
Luggage,"I love that these bags are made in China.  They don't have a lot of room for luggage, so it's nice to know you can get what you pay for on the plane.  The only thing I didn't like about this bag was how small they were.",GUIDED
Furniture,"Didn't work well for me.  I bought two of these in the same store and they were all very cheaply made. The only thing that annoyed me about them is how long it takes to put them together.  They are easy to assemble, so if you don't have a lot of time to glue them together then this will not hold up at all! I would definitely buy again.",NON-GUIDED
Pet Products,"Great product.  I have been using these for a couple of years now and love them so much!  They are easy to put together, they don't break down into tiny pieces like some other pet products do. I would highly recommend this product.",NON-GUIDED
Grocery,"Ok, I've had this for a couple of years.  It's always been one of my favorite things to do at the grocery store. My husband and I decided to give it a try because he absolutely loves it so much that we have him carry it with him on his back every now and then.  We also use it as a place to put food in our pantry (as well as other items). This bag is large enough to hold all kinds of stuff like utensils, nuts, cornbreads, cookies, muffins, candy, etc.  The only thing missing is the zippered pocket where you can take whatever you want without having to go through too much hassle.  There are plenty of pockets inside but they're not very big or bulky.  You don't really have to worry about them falling off if you haven't done anything wrong.",NON-GUIDED
Electronics,"First of all, I have to say that this is a very nice product.  It has many functions including: 1) Connects directly to the TV via USB and allows you to turn it on/off. 2) Allows me to connect my laptop via bluetooth (Bluetooth works great). 3) Provides an external microphone for voice communication with other devices which can also be used as audio accompaniments.  For those who are not audiophiles or just want something more immersive like surround sound, this will make your life much easier.  The built in speakers allow you to listen to music from any device without having to rely on plug-and-play equipment.  You can use them even if you do not have headphones plugged into the wall.  If you don't have earbuds plugged into the wall, they won't work at all.",NON-GUIDED

Kitchen,"No question about it.  It is very easy to set up, and the instructions are great! I have a small kitchen in my living room that has two bathrooms so there is plenty of space for everything. The only thing I would like to see change is how much wood can be used as a storage unit.  This will allow you to put some extra pounds on your stove top (and make sure not to over-compensate with other storage units).  However, if you want to store all kinds of items at once, this could be an issue.  If you don't know what they are made of, then go ahead and buy one from Amazon or similar stores around the world.",NON-GUIDED
Watches,"All eyes are on this one.  I bought it for my 2 year old granddaughter and she loves it so much that we ordered two of them separately. It is a nice looking watch with an easy to read face which can be adjusted by turning the dial up or down depending on how many hours you have left in your life.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was due to the lack of time, but rather than being able to change the day/time based on weather conditions (e.g. tropical heat), I decided to give it 3 stars instead of 4 because there were too many days &#34;normal&#34; times! I would definitely recommend this watch as it will hold up very well compared to other smartwatches out there.",NON-GUIDED

Luggage,"First of all, I wanted to share my experience with this luggage carrier.  It is very easy to set up and operate without having to go through a lot of hoops.  Easy to maneuver the bags into different compartments so you don't have to worry about your luggage being damaged or anything like that.  The only complaint I have is that it takes some getting used to because there are many compartments on the inside for things to be carried around. The first thing I did was take off the seatbelt (it's kind of hard to get out).  This allowed me to adjust the length of the belt by holding down the side of the handle while still keeping the bag in place.  However, after taking off the seatbelt at least once every 2-3 months, nothing happened.  My husband has had issues with his back problems over the past few months.",NON-GUIDED

It is very easy to put together but the instructions are not as clear as I would have hoped.

I would not recommend this product at all if you are looking for a quick &#34;start&#34; tool in your hands.  You will be hard pressed to figure out how to get started without having to do so.  If you don't know how to set up an internet connection (which may require some manual skill) then there is no one-line tutorial or video tutorial.  Once you have used these tools over and over again my experience with them has been nothing short of amazing.

That being said, if you're going to spend your money on something else, don't waste your hard earned dollars trying to make it as visually stunning as possible.

PC,"Just got this for my wife and she loves it.  It is very easy to set up, works well with her ipad but I have not had any problems with it.  The only thing that annoys me is the buttons on the bottom of the screen don't stay centered so if you are going to use a mouse pointer (which may or may not be an issue) there is no way to adjust the height of the screen when your computer is in the middle of a busy work day.  That being said...it does come with some kind of power cord which will allow you to control both devices easily.

I have not had any problems with the battery life until now.  It's been about 2 weeks since I purchased it (it will take some getting used to).

Video DVD,"I'd like to give you a good idea of what's going on in your DVD collection. 1. The sound is great and the picture quality is very good.  I'm not sure if it's due to lack of input, or because there are so many movies out there that don't have 3D audio at all.  You can't really go wrong with this Blu-ray player as most people seem to be obsessed with 4K content.  If you're looking for something more immersive than home theater, look no further! 2. It has lots of cool features (like voice acting) that make it easy to watch videos over and over again without having to worry about getting caught up in any other aspect of the game.  There are also tons of mini games where you can play as much as you want while still being able to move around freely.",NON-GUIDED

The installation instructions are pretty straightforward: First, you have to go into the Setup menu in order to get the DVD player installed. You will need to enter the following steps: 1. Launch the computer from the SD card located on your hard drive (i.e., an external hard drive).2. Enter the &#34;Software Update&#34; at the bottom of the CD/ROM tray.3.

It's the perfect size for my Nikon D3D DSLR with an extra 1/2&#34; of storage space (not included).  My only complaint is that it doesn't hold as much memory as some other cameras on the market.

It's not too big or too small (about 1/2&#34; wide) but smaller than what you would expect from an average man.  He doesn't seem to have any issues with the lining being stretched out after wearing it.  The only thing that bothered him most was how long his arms were able to reach down without hurting himself at all.  That said, there are plenty of stretch marks on the inside of the fabric so if you don't like them then they won't last much longer! I will definitely buy another pair in the future.",NON-GUIDED

The first thing you need to do is turn off the power button (on/off).

Video Games,My grandson will receive this game as a gift.,GUIDED
Tools,"Firstly, let me start by saying that I have never used any of these before.  These are the ones that come in handy when you need to use a hammer or something like that. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was because they were not very well made and don't seem sturdy enough for everyday use.  The main thing I noticed is how hard it is to get out of your tool without being super heavy.  It took me about an hour to get my hands on all those things but once I put them together (with some help from other tools), everything started to wobble quite a bit.  So far so good! I've had no problems with this type of hammer though.  This one has held up pretty well over the past few months after using several different types of hammers.",NON-GUIDED

Luggage,"Meets its intended purpose.  I was looking for a bag that could hold all of my stuff, but this one did not fit the bill. Pros:<br />-It's heavy and easy to carry (I don't think it will last)<br />-The zipper is sturdy enough to keep everything in place if you have luggage<br />-Cons:<br />-There are so many zippered pockets on the inside which make it difficult to find items without being crammed into them! If you're carrying an item with two zippered pockets at the same time, there may be some zippered space between the pocket and the shoulder strap making it hard to find items when traveling from city to town!!! Bottom Line:<br />-This bag is heavier than what I had expected...not as heavy as I would have liked.",NON-GUIDED

This unit has plenty of power, which means you don't have to worry about having to plug in all the extra wires on each side for things like air conditioning and electrical outlets. This unit comes with two USB 3.0 ports (for audio, video, etc.).  You can also connect this unit to your phone or tablet via bluetooth rather than using cable.  The main thing I love about this unit is how easy it is to use.  There are no instructions on how to set up/remove the connectors so if you're not familiar with them then they won't tell you anything.",NON-GUIDED

The only thing that annoys me most about it is the fact that there are so many pockets inside each one. I am not going to go into too much detail on how this will hold up...but if you don't want to lug around tons of stuff (and lots of other items) then this might be your bag for you! It does take some getting used to, but as long as you're willing to spend at least $20-30 dollars more than buying something else from Amazon or similar stores in the same price range.

It took me about an hour to figure out how to play them on my Nintendo 3DS (which is exactly what I was looking for).  The first thing I did was go through all the hoops you have to do to get into the game.  There are so many steps to complete each level before you can even start.  Once you've done all those steps, you're ready to go!  You'll be able to customize your character as well as move around in order to unlock more levels.

Pros:<br />- Very easy to install.<br />- Easy to use.<br />- Takes up less space in the drawer than my old ones.<br />- Easily wipes clean easily.<br />- Doesn't seem to be toxic at all.<br />- Does not come with batteries, so you'll need to keep an eye on your phone or tablet if you want to get rid of them.<br />- Will definitely buy another one as soon as they arrive.<br />- Has lots of storage options (for example pens, cell phones, etc.)<br />- Comes with 2 USB 3.0 ports which will allow me to plug in more devices without having to worry about losing battery.",NON-GUIDED

Musical Instruments,"Used with my Yamaha RX-3.  I have been using this for a couple of years now and it is working well.  The main thing to note is that the volume knob on the unit does not vibrate at all, so you can't really tell if your instrument is going to vibrate or not.  It also doesn't vibrate as much as some other instruments. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was due to the lack of clarity in the knobs which makes it difficult to see exactly what's going on.  Also, there are no instructions on how to adjust the amount of movement by adjusting the speed of the knob.  However, once you've adjusted the speed of the knob (which isn't an issue) then everything sounds fine! I would definitely recommend this product again.",NON-GUIDED

The only thing that annoyed me was how many times I tried to load games on my computer without any issues whatsoever - it took me about an hour or so to load everything at once! There were some minor graphical glitches in certain areas but they didn't really bother me as much as other reviewers had mentioned before.  It just wasn't worth the $30-$50 extra you would get if you did not want to spend all your money on something else (e.g. Mass Effect 3).

Luggage,"I'd like to give this one a try.  It's not as big as I thought it would be, but you can get what you pay for without the extra cost of shipping.  There are so many things that need to be said about this luggage carrier: 1) The price is very reasonable and easy to set up. 2) If you don't have an internet connection on your phone or tablet (like my wife does), there will be no additional charges available at the airport.  So if you do have an internet connection in your country, then they won't charge you anything more than US$10 ($20).  That being said, having an internet connection doesn't mean you're going anywhere.  You'll want to check out airports around the world where you can take advantage of cheaper international service.  However, once you've done that, you may want to look elsewhere.",NON-GUIDED

I have had no problems sleeping on my bed or in front of my dogs. The only reason I didn't order this was because there were so many different types of beds/plasmasks available at the same time. However, they all worked out perfect as soon as I put them together.  They would not budge from laying on top of each other due to the shape of the bed being compared to others. This allowed me to sit comfortably without having to move around much more often. It also allowed me to relax while doing yard work (which required me to constantly change positions). Overall, I highly recommend this product.",NON-GUIDED

This is one of those things where you need to know what you're doing and then figure out how to do it. I've never been a sports fan so I thought I'd give this 5 stars but after reading some of the reviews, I decided to give it a try: 1. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of great sportswear brands out there in the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Trinidad & Tobago (and many more others), as well as just about any other type of shoe. 2.

Cons<br />- It does take some practice to figure out how to adjust the shutter speed as well as adjusting the amount of light used in the picture. Bottom line: If you are going to buy this camera for yourself or someone else, be prepared to spend more money on something like this...",NON-GUIDED

It doesn't take up much space at all when you're sitting in front of your Prius The only thing I can say is that there aren't any external hard drives out there besides the USB 3.0 port!  You have to plug them into an optical drive or something like that which will allow you to transfer files from one device to another without having to worry about disk corruption.

This device lets me stream music without having to worry about plugging into an internet connection.  That being said, if you want to listen to music while surfing or browsing through web sites, this is great!

You can actually see where the LCD was coming from If you're looking for an easy way to photograph someone without having to go through many layers of hard photoshop or anything like that, then this may be the one place you'll want to spend more than $300-$400 per lens.

That said, there are many cheaper and better options out there.  In my opinion, this DVD comes with some nice features: 1. You can stream movies from your home theater system via blu-ray players; 2.

Once you've done that, you can now use Skype instead of FaceBook.",NON-GUIDED

There are several steps that need to be taken before you can get started: 1) You will need an internet connection in order to access the instructions on how to set up your utensil.  If you don't know how to set up your own internet connection, or if you just want to learn more about setting up your own internet connection, then this may not be the right thing to do.  It doesn't take much skill to set up your own internet connection as there are many different ways to set up your own internet connection.",NON-GUIDED

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the small nature of the sizing chart.

Office Products,"I'll update this review if I have any problems with the unit.  The first time I used it, there was no power outages or other issues. The second time I used it for a job that requires an outlet to be connected via USB 3.0 (which is not what I had in mind). So far so good.  It has held up very well and seems to hold up quite well.",NON-GUIDED
Luggage,"Used this for a trip to the Dominican Republic.  Arrived quickly and was very happy with it.  The only thing I didn't like is how long it took to get my luggage out of the customs area.  Also, there were no tags on the front that prevented me from getting into the country.",NON-GUIDED

Outdoors,"Often times when I have to use a door opener, it will not open.  It is very difficult to open and close the door without opening. This has been a problem with many doors in my family's house since they were built on top of each other.  They are prone to being knocked off by dogs or cats due to their aggressive behavior.  This resulted in me having to buy another door opener from Home Depot for $30-$40 instead of buying this one over at Wal-Mart.  If you're looking for an inexpensive door opener that can be used as a side door opener, this may be the best option.",NON-GUIDED
Beauty,"Of the set of these shoes, they are very comfortable and look great on my feet. I wear them every day for about two weeks with no problems.",GUIDED

Baby,I looked at this product and thought it would be great.  It is very simple to set up. The first thing I noticed was that the buttons on the bottom of the screen are a little small (about 6&#34;) but not too big for my liking.,GUIDED

Books,"Before the book was written, I thought it would be interesting to see if they were available in English.  After reading all the other reviews about this book, I decided to give it a try. First of all, let me start off by saying that I have not read any books before.  This is my first time reading anything new or unfamiliar.  In fact, I've been following The Black Lagoon series for quite some time and haven't had any problems with it at all.  For instance, there are so many good books out there on the Internet today that I couldn't even begin to pick them up.  That being said, I'm glad I did!  If you're looking for something different from your average high school history class library (or just someone who doesn't know much), look no further...",NON-GUIDED

Lawn and Garden,"From time to time we use this for our garden.  It has a lot of storage space, so it is very easy to set up. The only thing I would like to change is that the lid can be turned on/off if you are not careful about opening or closing the lid.  This will also make it difficult to open the bag when trying to access the contents from the outside.",NON-GUIDED

Health & Personal Care,"Here's my advice: 1. If you are going to use this product, be sure to read the directions before using it. 2. You will need a good set of ear plugs for your ears.  This is not recommended if you don't have any ear plugs that can fit into your ears.  However, I do recommend these ear plugs because they provide more protection than most ear plugs in general. 3. These ear plugs work great!  They help keep your ears warm and healthy while keeping them warm during music.  The sound quality isn't as good or better than other ear plugs out there. 4. Don't waste your money unless you plan on buying another pair of ear plugs from Amazon.",NON-GUIDED
Jewelry,"Before I got started with this, I wanted to start by saying that it is my first experience with jewelry. After reading some of the other reviews, I decided to go ahead and buy a new one. I was so excited when I opened the box thinking about buying another one! It arrived in perfect condition: - The color is exactly what I had been looking for (blue/purple) - There are no instructions on how to set them up but you will need an internet browser like Google Chrome or WINDOWS Internet Explorer which can be found at http://www.amazon.",NON-GUIDED

Sports,"Ok, I was a little disappointed in the quality of this product.  It does what it's supposed to do and doesn't take up much space. Pros:<br />1) The color is very bright (blue), 2) You can see &#34;fades&#34; at night<br />3) There are many different colors that you can see on the screen as well(*)<br />4) This has an LED light for nighttime viewing with dimming/darkening modes which make it easy to adjust brightness without having to worry about dark spots or anything like that. Cons:<br />1) If you want to watch sports games from all over the world then this is your best bet.  Also if you're looking for something more casual look no matter where you stand but still have time to catch some footballs off the field during warm weather.",NON-GUIDED

Wireless,"Check: Yes, it does work but you can't tell the difference between a standard cable and wireless router.  You have to go through several hoops to get that right.

Video Games,"Arrived in a timely manner.  The story is well written and the characters are believable. The game itself is very good, but it's not as good as some of the other games that I've played.  It was an easy sell for me to get my money's worth.  That said, if you're looking for a video game with great graphics then this is your pick.",NON-GUIDED
Wireless,"If you are looking for a wireless router that will allow you to charge your cell phone, this is the case.  I have been using it for about 2 months now and no issues.

I do wish there was an easy way to hook up wifi without having to worry about getting lost in WiFi. The only thing i don't like about this one is its lack of features.",NON-GUIDED

Furniture,The fabric was tacky and had a lot of wear on it.,GUIDED
PC,"Not sure if this is a good product, but it does.  I have an old PC that had to be replaced every few years and couldn't figure out how to use the new ones. Pros:<br />- Easy to install (no installation required)<br />- Built in USB 3.0 port<br />- Bluetooth 4.0<br />- Fast charging so you don't have to worry about getting lost on your phone or other device when transferring files from one computer to another<br />Cons:<br />- Doesn't hold up very well for long periods of time while gaming<br />- Does not seem to work as well with older games like Plants vs.",NON-GUIDED

Toys,"Fun game, components and fun to play.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the price.",GUIDED
Lawn and Garden,"Recently purchased a new home for my 3 year old grandson.  He loves the fact that he can play with it in his bedroom without having to do anything else. I have yet to find out how this works, but I'm glad I did! It's easy to set up, so you don't have to go into any of the manual steps before setting it up.  There are no instructions on how to turn it on or off, just hands-down (you will need an internet connection).  It also comes with two mini bookshelf storage areas - one as a spare room where you can store all your stuff if needed.  The only other thing I would say is that there aren't any instructions on how to turn it on/off...but they're pretty helpful too.",NON-GUIDED
Home Improvement,"Here's a list of the most common &#34;things&#34; you can do to improve your home repair: 1) Build quality is very good. 2) You have to be careful not to screw in any screws or bolts.  If you don't want to install something else, it may take some time for them to get used to. 3) The first thing I did was try and figure out how to make sure everything fit correctly.  This took me about 2-3 weeks to figure out.  After that, I made sure everything had been properly aligned before using this tool.  It took me about 4-5 weeks to figure things out.  That included putting all the screws together into the slots on the bottom of the carabiner (where they were supposed to hold).  Then my carabiner came off with no help at all.",NON-GUIDED
Sports,Great product. Very happy with my purchase and the price.,NON-GUIDED
Video Games,"Do yourself a favor and buy this game for the PS4.  The graphics are very good, but it's not all that great as some other games do. Pros:<br />1) 1) You can't beat the price of Call of Duty or Need for Speed out there. 2) There is tons of replay value in every aspect.<br />3) It's fun to play online with friends without having to worry about getting killed by enemies.<br />4) If you don't want to spend hours playing Mass Effect 3 (or Halo 4 if you're going to save your life trying to figure out how to get rid of those pesky ""bosses"" from Day One?  I've found myself wanting more multiplayer options than ever before.  That being said, here's my take on buying this game for the PS4.",NON-GUIDED
Toys,"Just what I was looking for.  It's a good size and fits perfectly in my purse.  The only thing is that it doesn't come with a zipper, so if you don't like the look of it, then this will not fit your duffel bag or carry-on luggage. I would highly recommend this item to anyone who wants their gear on the go.",NON-GUIDED
Office Products,"Overall quality is very good.  I bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it.  We have a lot of room in the living room so we don't need to worry about getting dirty or anything like that.  It does look nice on her dresser, but not super comfy at all.",NON-GUIDED

Shoes,"Generally, I like to order a size smaller than my normal size.  However, this is not the sizing chart that I would have liked.  For example, if you are 5'3&#34; and weigh 250 pounds, it will be listed as 8"" instead of 9"".  In other words, if you are 6'2&#34; or 209 lbs, it will be listed as 7"" instead of 10"".  So, for someone with an average build, they don't know much about sizing at all.  That being said, these shoes are very well made.",NON-GUIDED

Furniture,"Awesome!  I bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it.  She has a lot of room to put things in there, but the furniture is very nicely made.  The only thing that annoys her is how long it takes to get from one piece of furniture to another. I have not had any issues with anything falling apart over time or pieces falling apart during shipping.  It took me about an hour to remove all the pieces because they were piled on top of each other.  There was no way to clean them up after putting everything together properly.  So far so good.",NON-GUIDED

Home,"It's been a while since I bought it, but now I'm really happy with the quality of the product.  The color is very clear and easy to read. The only thing that annoys me about this particular case is the fact that there are no buttons on the side so you have to press one button every time you need them. If you're looking for a quick way to quickly access your phone or tablet without having to make any sort of fuss, this may not be the case! I don't know how many times I've used my Samsung Galaxy S4/S5 (not sure if they actually came with their own battery packs), but when I got home from work in less than an hour, I couldn't help but feel like someone was trying to extricate themselves from the mess by typing &#34;smooth&#34; at the top of the screen.",NON-GUIDED

The only thing i would say is that if you are looking for an easy way to get out of your living room by turning on/off electrical outlets, this may be the best solution.

You could do that by setting the &#34;setting&#34; at the bottom of the screen, then turning off the volume knob in order to make adjustments.  That would take me about 3-4 hours depending on which one you turn on, but my wife has no problems adjusting her light so far.

It's very easy to set up and operate without having to worry about the TV being turned on or off.  There are several different ways you can adjust the brightness/vibration settings depending on how much you want it to do.  For example: 1) Holds an external hard drive (i.e. USB 3.0), which is located at the top of the unit.  This will allow you to connect your hard drive directly to your computer via USB if needed.

These flower beds are easy to move around (they can be removed by putting some kind of plastic container).  You don't want to put too much pressure on your plants to get rid of all the debris that's already accumulated throughout the plant bed.  It doesn't take any effort to remove everything from the pile but it does make a very nice decorative decoration.  The best thing about these roses is that if you're trying to decorate an ornamental home at night, there aren't enough platoons out there to fill those platoons out.",NON-GUIDED

Outdoors,"Recently purchased a second one for me.  This one is of the nicest and most comfortable hiking boots I've ever owned.  It's wide enough to comfortably fit my foot, so it doesn't take up much room at all.  The only complaint I have is that there are small pockets on either side of the shoe.",NON-GUIDED
Tools,Just what I was looking for.  Easy to install and easy to use.  Would definitely buy again.,NON-GUIDED
Tools,"This is a great tool for the job.  It does what I need it to do and works just as well. I have used other types of tools, but this one has some limitations.  The first thing I noticed was that there were no instructions on how to set up an SD card, so I had to go through all the manual steps before setting up an SD card. The second thing I noticed was that you can't figure out how to install an SD card in your home or anywhere else.  You're going to have to be very careful not to use any kind of wall mount hardware (e.g. 3-pin screws).  There are many different mounting options available: For example, if you want to mount an external hard drive via USB, you will need to make sure they come pre-drilled with holes drilled into the slots at the bottom of the drives themselves.",NON-GUIDED

The only thing I would like to mention is that there are no instructions on how to set up or how to setup an SD card. If you're looking for a quick way to get things done, here's my review: 1. Set Up Your PC (or anywhere else) 2. Setup Everything You Need To Know On A Core i7-4770 @ 2GB RAM 3. Connecting One USB 3.0 port(s) 4. Setting Up Your PC With An HDMI cable 5.",NON-GUIDED

Video DVD,"Ok, I have no idea what the reason is for not liking it.  It's a very nice Blu-Ray player with lots of options to choose from. I've been using this player on my Samsung Galaxy S4 since its first couple months.  The sound quality is excellent and there are plenty of apps that you can use to hook up your TV or other smart devices.  There are so many great apps out there that I don't want to spend hours trying to figure out how to hook up an Apple TV. If you're looking for a portable streaming video player (iPad/iPhone) then this is the way to go.  You'll be able to hook up any device at any time without having to worry about which one you will love most.",NON-GUIDED
Watches,"From Amazon.com I ordered this watch as a gift for my husband and he loves it so much that I bought another one. This is the first time I have owned a watch in less than two years with no issues or problems. If you are looking for an easy to read watch, look no further! This watch looks great on his wrist (as well as many other smart watches) but not very good at keeping your hands warm while wearing &#34;watches&#34;.  It also has a nice built-in timer which will let you know when things are about to get really hot without having to worry about how long they last. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the fact that it doesn't seem to take up too much room in the main compartment inside the watch itself.",NON-GUIDED

Beauty,"Meets my needs very well.  I am 5'2&#34; and weigh 205 lbs.  This is the perfect size for a baby who has an eye on her own when it comes to weightlifting.  It was easy to put together, but not as sturdy as others have mentioned. If you are looking for quality materials that can be used in any kind of activity, this is definitely what you need.  My only complaint would be if your child does not want to take off his or her shoes because they don't fit properly.",NON-GUIDED

Kitchen,its very good but I had to order a second one for my daughter.  She is 5'3&#34; and weighs 145 pounds so it's not super comfy at all.  The only thing that made her uncomfortable was the fact that she could hardly see herself in the middle of the dining room.,GUIDED

Home Improvement,This is a great tool to help with the maintenance of your house.  It does everything you need it to do and I am very happy with my purchase.,GUIDED
Lawn and Garden,"Here's my recommendation: 1) If you are looking for a quick, easy way to store all your plants in the garden, this is it.  It takes up less space than an old wooden table top. 2) You will not be able to remove any of the leaves that have been removed from the wood floor as well (such as stems or other plant matter).  The only reason I do not recommend this is if you don't want to use &#34;clarification&#34; to remove some of the leaves that have already been removed.  This can be done by simply removing the clarification/clarification on the bottom of the potting area where the stem was originally placed.  There is no “clarification&#34; at all so make sure you carefully follow the directions set out in the instructions provided with the potting lotion.",NON-GUIDED
Toys,Going to the store and buying another one.,NON-GUIDED
Home Improvement,"Nice product.  I bought this for my 2 year old grandson and he loves it. It is very easy to set up, put in place the screws on the back of the car (as well as the front door), and you are ready to go! I have had no problems installing or even turning on/off when there is not a power source plugged in.  The only thing i don't like about it is that if your child doesn't know how to turn on/off after some time they will be able to do so without having to worry about anything being done. The whole home improvement feature is great--it has all the bells and whistles but none of them make it into the living room.  It's just too much hassle trying to figure out how to get rid of those pesky wires with little help from the &#34;Electronics Technician&#34;.",NON-GUIDED
Home Entertainment,I watch 3D movies on my Samsung Galaxy S3.  I love that it comes with an SD card and a USB flash drive.  The only downside is that the remote does not allow you to use your phone or tablet without having to unplug it.,GUIDED

Books,"Despite being a very good book, I have not read any of the other books.  This one is by far my favorite. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is that there are so many spoilers here and there.  If you don't know what to expect from this book then look no further! Author David Frankel has written an excellent series about his life in New York City: The Making of a New York Times Best Seller (2000).  His most recent book was titled ""A New York Times Best Seller"", which he describes as follows: 1. A New York Times Best Seller with a Cover-Up &#34;Citizen Kane&#34; 2.

I bought it to wear as a Christmas present for my 7 year old daughter.  It was very cute, but not too girly.  The sleeves were just too big (about 3 1/2 inches) so they didn't hold up well at all.

Shoes,"Sometimes I get compliments on the size of my shoes, but this one is just what I needed.  It's a bit large and not too big to wear at all.  The only thing that bothered me was how long it would last (about 5-10 days).  So much so that I decided to give it a try.  When I got home from work about an hour ago, there were no words to describe how long it would last. It has held up quite well since being put together.  There are plenty of pockets for extra stuff like socks, t-shirts, or whatever else you'd want in your life.  We'll see how long it lasts over the next few months as we figure out how durable it will be.  Also, if you're looking for a good pair of flip flops, these might be the right size for you! Overall, very pleased with this purchase.",NON-GUIDED
Tools,"Sometimes I don't have time to use these.  They are a little heavy, but they do work for me. I bought two of them in the mail and both worked great! The only thing that bothered me was how long it took to unzip the file from my computer.  It took about 2-3 hours to unzip the entire file (which is exactly what I needed).  The instructions were easy to follow: 1. Unzip the folder you just copied/paste into your computer.  Then make sure there is an icon on the top left or right side where you want to place the files.  This will be handy if you need to store multiple copies after each transfer.  You can also simply put all the folders under the same folder as before with no problems. 2.",NON-GUIDED

It's been years since I've tasted something like this before (I'm glad I did). My brother-in-law has made some really good stuff here at Gage Tavern over the years, but he doesn't seem to have much experience making anything from scratch.

There are no instructions on what to turn it on or off - they just say ""on/off"".

I've been looking for a better way to decorate my dining room since I was 10 years old when I first saw this in the back of my living room.  The only thing that kept me from getting used to it was how easy it was to set it up.  My husband has always had issues with his cabinets falling apart after just a few months (even though he doesn't have any furniture around him anymore).  So far so good! The wood looks really nice but isn't exactly what we were looking for.  We'll see how it holds up quite a bit longer than our previous Ikea style kitchen chairs.

I love the fact that there are two sizes of buttons which can be flipped up or down depending on how big your tummy is There's also a button called &#34;reset&#34; which lets you change the amount of calories you burn each day by turning off the timer every few days (i.e. when i am at work).",NON-GUIDED

You will be hard pressed to find anything on Amazon that does not require one of these bells or whistles.  However, if you don't want to spend more than $20 dollars just buy one at a local hardware store in your area.  If you're looking for inexpensively made products that do NOT require one of these bells or whistles, then look no further.  Home Improvement's website states that they offer ""the following services: 1. Connecting &#34;Electronics Functionality&#34; to Bluetooth® 3.",NON-GUIDED

The only thing that annoys me about it is how easy it is to put together.  If you don't have time to do all of the assembling (which isn't really a big deal) then there are no instructions on how to set it up or how to assemble it.  You'll need an internet browser to figure out how to use it.  There aren't any instructions on how to turn it into a piece of jewelry.

This player comes with 2 USB ports (3.0 x 3.0 x 1.2) which allow you to plug it into an external hard drive via USB port in order to transfer files from one device to another.

The instructions are pretty easy to follow (if you don't know how to use them) First off let me start by saying that there is no &#34;keyboard&#34; in this case. The keyboard does not have any keys/slides or anything like that.  You can just press Ctrl+Alt+F while pressing C for whatever you want.  This will allow you to customize your keyboard as much as you desire without having to go through tons of manual steps.  It also lets you choose from many different color options besides white depending on which one you prefer.",NON-GUIDED

Toys,"Have a lot of fun with this game.  It's not difficult to figure out how to play it, but there are so many things you can do. 1) Go ahead and buy your own Lego set for the kids!  They will love it if they don't get bored at all.  I've seen other games that require skill levels in order to unlock certain items or abilities (e.g. swords, etc.). 2) If you want to learn more about characters like Wal-Mart owner Wally West, go ahead and buy one as soon as you find him on the train...you'll be good to go.  This is by far my favorite video game experience.  The graphics are very nice too.  There are tons of cool moments where you can actually explore different parts of the world without having to worry about getting caught up in any particular plot line.",NON-GUIDED

Play it on blu-ray for about 10 minutes at a time in front of your home theater where you can watch movies or listen to music as long as you are willing to let others do the same. 3.

It also comes with two USB 2.0 ports which allows you to plug in any device other than your phone (e.g. iPod touch). The unit has plenty of features but not enough power to charge all the devices at once.  The only thing i don't like about it is its lack of charging port.  You have to be careful if you are going to use an external power source when trying to charge/discharge those devices.  If you want to get rid of some chargers then go ahead and buy one from Amazon.  This will allow you to charge multiple devices simultaneously while still keeping the same amount charged each time.",NON-GUIDED

Tools,"I'd like to see a better way to use them.  They're very sturdy and work well on my bike, but I'm not sure if they'll hold up at all.  It's also worth noting that the handlebars are made in China so you can't go wrong with this product. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the lack of quality control.  This may be due to the fact that some parts were scratched or broken during shipping (which might have been an issue for me). But overall, I would definitely recommend this product.",NON-GUIDED
Toys,"Checked are great!  We have a lot of T-shirts and t-shirts, so I thought we'd try them out.  The quality is just right for our home office. The only thing that bothered me was how small the shirts were (about 3&#34; in diameter).  They fit snugly on my shirt but not too big or too small.

Toys,"If you are looking for a good fit, this is it.  I am 5'3&#34; and weigh 205 pounds.  It was easy to put together but the instructions don't say much about how to do that. I ordered two sizes larger than my normal size because they were too small.  The only thing I didn't like was the fact that there was no &#34;cut outs&#34; on the bottom of the box which caused me to have an issue with them being cut out.",NON-GUIDED

Grocery,"When I first opened the box it looked like a lot of stuff. It was large enough to hold all kinds of items, but not so big that you could hardly see them. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there are no instructions on how to turn it on or off. You will have to go through some manual troubleshooting and figure out how to turn it on/off (you can do that yourself). I would recommend this product for anyone who wants an easy way to keep things organized in order to make sure they don't get caught up in any of the other ways.",NON-GUIDED

It has tons of replay value too!  You'll be able to play as many characters as you want without having to worry about getting sucked into an all-encompassing mini-marital affair.

Musical Instruments,"Having been using these for a while now, I have not had any problems with them.  They are very well made and easy to set up. My only complaint is that the buttons on the front of the tuners don't work at all.  If you listen to music from other devices like iPods or iPod touch, this may be an issue.  You can adjust the volume slightly by turning the aux jack on/off in order to make it sound as loud as possible.  However, once you turn the aux port on (or off) your iPod Touch, there isn't much to worry about.  That being said, if you want to play music from another device without having to use the aux plug-and-play button again, they won't do that either.",NON-GUIDED

That said, my wife is 6'1&#34; and weighs 185 pounds!  She also has plenty of room in her front pocket for something she doesn't want anywhere else.

For those who are not familiar with mountain biking, this may be your first foray into outdoor gear.  In fact, I was able to get used to using some form of resistance training (e.g. strength training).

I would have liked to see how well they compare to other similar sized lingerie stores though.  This one was definitely better than my old ones which were more &#34;wide&#34; width.

For example: 1) Pressing key &#34;5&#34; in seconds (or so I thought) will take about 3-4 hours without any problems. 2) Pressing/losing keys won't let you know which one they are going to be if you want to press them while pressing anything more than once.

Home Improvement,"Generally speaking, home improvement products tend to be more expensive.  This is because of the high price tag associated with a product. Home Improvement Products are often advertised as being affordable and easy to install.  However, when you buy this product, it will take some getting used to.  Home Improvement Products typically have two or three levels of quality control that can be gauged by many factors (e.g., how much water needs to be pumped into each unit). For example, if you want to make sure your furnace has enough steam to maintain its temperature, you might want to look at an air filter system that produces fine lines on certain parts of the house.

I've used many different types of office products over the years since I purchased them.  The first one was an Office Products Manager (OLM).

Since then there has been a lot of improvement in terms of design and functionality.  However, for those who are new to using Office Products Management Software they may want to look elsewhere.  If you're looking for something more user friendly with regards to things like color selection, fonts, etc., be sure to check these out!

Cons:<br />1) You don't have to worry about your baby getting hurt or anything else you can think of.<br />2) It doesn't hold up very well in my hands, so if you're looking for something that holds up really well (e.g. earrings), then these may not hold up very well with regular use!<br />3) The strap on the back isn't as tight as some other straps we've used, but there's no reason to be concerned when trying to put an end to the strap without being too tight. 4) There aren't any tears/tweaks out there at all.

The first thing I did not do was remove the top piece of furniture from the box by pulling out all the pieces (and then putting them back in). It took me about 5 minutes to put everything together but there were so many pieces you could hardly see on the outside of the box.  The only thing I noticed was how much more difficult it would be to get into the woodwork without having to use some kind of metal saw to cut through these pieces.",NON-GUIDED

Luggage,"Do yourself a favor and buy this bag.  It's the size you'd expect it to be. Pros:<br />- The zipper compartments are large, but not too big for most people (as opposed to just over 1/2&#34;).<br />- There is plenty of room in the luggage compartment for extra storage space if you need something more zippered or sturdier than your standard carry-on baggage pick-up bag.  Cons:<br />- You can't put anything on top of it that isn't super heavy like other bags do.  I don't think there should be any sort of padding around the inside of the bag so as not to make things claustrophobic while still being able to access items from all kinds of places without having to worry about getting caught up in them.",NON-GUIDED

First of all, it's not rocket science -- there are no known &#34;nuclear fission devices&#34; out there that can be used to create fusion weapons or something like that. This device is made in China and has been tested on several occasions by the U.S. Army Advanced Research Projects Agency (AARPA). The first one was near-miss when it came to striking down an atomic weapon at Nagasaki two years ago. It didn't hit much hard enough but did get close enough to hitting targets without being too far away from the intended target.

You'll never know what you've seen in person until you see all of the different cast members (and even some extras) from previous films. 2. There aren't really any special effects for this movie; they're just background noises rather than actual music.  It doesn't sound like real music at all.

If you are looking for something to add to your wardrobe, look no further.  You won't be able to wear it anywhere near as many bells or whistles as you want.  However, if you are looking for an inexpensive way to decorate your home with lots of bells and whistles, this might be the right choice. 3.  The color is really cool too.

Second, if you have been looking for an easy way to access your belongings without having to worry about getting caught up in some sort of ""lock-down"" process (which can take weeks or even months depending on where you're going with it). Third, once you've done that, you'll want to know exactly what kind of lock-down works and how many times you need to use it.  For example, if you don't have any type of lock-down capability, then you may want to go ahead and buy something similar. 4.",NON-GUIDED

However, for some reason we've come to accept that there aren't many sports programs out there that can entertain you or motivate you at all.

I am 5'9&#34; and weigh 205 pounds so they fit quite well.  That being said, if you're looking for an athletic shoe with some form of arch support, this is probably your go-to option.  If you've got any type of arch support (e.g., wide toe), it's pretty much what you'll be looking for.  These aren't too big or too small at all, but still have plenty of room in your upper midriff.  For someone who just wants something more substantial, these are definitely going to work for you!

There are so many different ways to zoom in and out. If you're looking for a DSLR like this, look no further.  You will be hard pressed to find a better one on Amazon than this one.  My only complaint is that there aren't any built-in features (e.g. manual shutter speed).  That's not an issue at all.

The only thing I would like to point out is that you will need an air compressor or something built into the rear tire before using them.  This can be done by tightening the front tires so that they don't get too hot during driving (i.e., when i want to turn off the engine).

They all have their fair share of problems with each other as well.

After that, it took me a while to figure out how to make the most of Grand Theft Auto games. This is one of those games where you have to take responsibility for what you are doing in order to accomplish your goal.  You must do everything possible to get this game onto the system.  That being said, if you play Grand Theft Auto 5 or any other video game (i.e., Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare) then you will probably want to go ahead and buy some extra copies as well.

For those who don't know anything about video games, you'll be hard pressed to figure out why there aren't so many AAA titles out there right now!

There is no &#34;glue&#34; on either side of the cover.  It's much easier to install than using an airbrush or spray paint tool.  If you don't know what kind of glue your fingers will stick onto the cover (which doesn't happen often) then there is no glue at all.  You just need to use one hand instead of the other.",NON-GUIDED

If you're looking for a portable way to listen to music without having to worry about getting bogged down by wires, this might be the perfect solution.

Musical Instruments,"Our son-in law is a huge fan of this instrument.  He loves it and has been using it for over a year now.  We have not had any issues with the tuning, but he was very pleased to find out that these instruments are made in China. The only thing I don't like about them is that they come pre-drilled so you can't really tell which strings are which (hopefully) which will be played first on your mandolin.  It also doesn't take up too much space at all! I would definitely recommend these if you're looking for a cheap sounding instrument from China.  You won't want to waste your time or money trying to figure out how to use &#34;speakers&#34; as some other reviewers have mentioned before.",NON-GUIDED

If you're looking for an easy-to-use way to store clothes on the counter, this may be the answer.  You'll have to figure out how to place them in different places before putting them into storage.  There are plenty of small items that don't fit snugly inside (e.g., socks, etc.).",NON-GUIDED

I like the fact that there are so many different types of plants in my garden!  The best part is that you don't have to worry about them falling off or anything - they're all on the same level as any other type of plant.  That being said, these flowers can last quite a while (if not longer) before succulents will grow out of them.  This isn't an issue at all...",NON-GUIDED

The quality is very good and easy to carry. The only complaint I have is that there are small pockets on the inside of the bag which make it difficult to open when you're carrying items like food, socks, etc.  This means if you don't want to put something in your luggage (for example an iPad or some other kind of item) then be careful not to let loose any items at all.",NON-GUIDED
Video Games,"Often times when they don't make a huge impact on the lives of their children, it's good to see that these games are doing what they were supposed to do. I've been playing Call of Duty for several years now and have never seen anything like this before. I think there is something special about Call of Duty that has made me want to play Call of Duty: Black Ops II more than once in my life. This game presents you with an incredible amount of replay value as opposed to just some other video game. The graphics are amazing and look fantastic even if you're not level or level-altering at all.
