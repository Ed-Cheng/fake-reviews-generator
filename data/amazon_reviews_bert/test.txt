It is not all that difficult to put together although the directions aren't the best. I am not the most able in using a drill but had no problem putting this together.

Believe me, paying less than 290.00 (which included free shipping and for some reason no sales tax was added) The picture has been crystal clear, sound quality is good (did purchase SONY sound bar system at the same time with the money I saved) Set-up was ridiculously easy (in my bedroom) and sha-zam!

It's just like a real phone and I really enjoyed exploring all that this watch can do.

Instead of having two Pvc pipes through the outside wall, you have a clean cut look that goes well with any home. Styrofoam is sturdy and very hard. It present itself as a durable product. One side for clean outside air and the other side for the exhaust. Considering the furnace is a high efficient to super efficient only.

The Dill and Slate Blue looks really nice on, so, I am keeping them, but I Was mortified to see the red looks more like and orange-red and looked awful on my skin tone, I am a winter and look better in cool jewel tones even though I can wear some other cool autumn colors. I wrote to the seller and printed out the return label and will ship it back Monday morning before I go to work at 10:30am. Since there was no choice for return or exchange, I went ahead and ordered a navy, burgundy, brown, and white, I should get them by the 22nd. The material is a nice quality, soft and comfortable. I took the advice of the other reviewer to size up, which I am glad I did. I wear a size 14 large in tops. XL fits comfortable without hugging. They are a straight cut; I am glad I have found a non-stretch polo. These pique polos skim enough to just above the thigh (between hip and thigh socket) just covers the abdomen. I like the two button placket and goes into a V... classy. The arm has a bit of gap, but I don't mind, I need the movement since I need to reach overhead to get supplies or planters off of shelves. I don't like being restricted to where it is uncomfortable. I I highly recommend Devon & Jones D100W Women's Pima Pique Polo 100%. Butter yellow is soft yellow. Burgundy is a red-brown. Navy is a true Navy Slate Blue is medium blue/grey. Purple is eggplant purple. Dill is a bit lighter than the forest green and muted. Red is like and orange/red, French Blue is between a Patriot Blue and Peacock Blue, not overly bright, but a nice tone of blue. Update 8/2015 I bought couple more to replace the two that got stained bad and am looking to see if there are newer colors.lot."

Very tinny sound with lack of base. If I crank up the volume the plastic enclosure starts vibrating causing discoloration of the sound. I am now using regular bookshelf speakers instead.

Use it under eye area and around eyes. I don't use it on browbone area (but that's just me, perhaps). This is light, has a pleasant faint fragrance and is silky smooth. The ONLY thing I will note is that you have to be very careful not to dispense too much. It only takes a wee bit to do the job. I don't know if the dispenser can be redesigned but that's a thought. Not a problem--just a caution. The product itself does just what it claims; improves the appearance and texture of that delicate under-eye skin. I'm glad I tried both of these Petunia products.

Since there are 100 caps, this will last me a long time. The plastic is thin, but not fragile or delicate, and the band on the edge gives it a good grip around my head.

13419,__label2__,3,Y,Furniture,B003TPAV3E,Coaster Desks Laptop Computer Stand with Adjustable Swivel Top and Casters,mediocre laptop table,"This laptop desk isn't great, but it isn't terrible either. Here's why: 1. It was fairly simple to put together. I did it on my own in about half an hour. The instructions were easy enough and the parts were few. There is one step were an actual screw driver is required. 2. It is functional. I can adjust the height to whatever I need. I prefer to sit in the living room at my couch while I work but sometimes I do slide into bed with my laptop too. No problem. The top tilt works nice, though the little pieces to prevent sliding on either end are a bit uncomfortable for typing. I will have to elevate my laptop to make it more comfortable. 3. Product components are a bit on the cheap side. The tops are particle board. The pieces to prevent sliding, mentioned above, are just kind of pushed into the tops themselves. While I haven't lost one, I worry will pop out as they aren't really mounted with anything. Having them screwed in would have been a better design I think. 4. Nice little side table. I had hoped to use this for my wireless mouse, but I just don't think that will work while using this table in the tilted down position. It puts the side table a bit too high to accommodate it comfortably. 5. The wheels are there, but you may not know it. They don't glide very well on carpet or hardwood. I have both in my home. 6. It isn't reversible. It isn't a big deal for my own use, but it could be a big problem for those who move around a lot with it. I wasn't overly impressed and I think there are some obvious design improvements to be had, but it works. It is a big step up from what I had, which was nothing. Quality and expectation would have been better established if it was more appropriately priced at under $30 in my opinion. If this holds up for a couple years I will be shocked. * Initial review. I will update on durability as appropriate."

He has turned his nose up at several toys and gadgets in the past. He is afraid of the unknown - so much so, that he wouldn't let me even approach him with another grooming tool. When he hears the velcro, he sits down expecting to be petted. He is typically afraid of my son but becomes VERY affectionate when my son is using this mitt. Lots of head butting and licking. This is pretty universally seen as approval from the cat. He is welcome to leave any time, but stays for extended period of times when using the love glove. EASY TO USE: The use of this mitt is completely natural. Put it on, and start petting your feline (or canine) friend. Cleaning fur off of this mitt is very easy. I usually just peel the hair off, although it can be rinsed as well. QUALITY: I have had this for over two years and it has not fallen apart or become damaged in any way. CRITICISM: Some say this doesn't do a good enough job of removing fur, and/or fills up too fast. Maybe true. But if it makes my cat happy, I guess that's all I need. BOTTOM LINE: While your mileage may vary, I am confident this will work for many cat &#34;owners&#34; as it has worked for me. I recommend you buy it. In fact, I am buying a second so I can use it on both hands at once."

The cinematography was great for the 1980s with a far better quality than the typical British TV show of the era.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The cinematography of the main series was more typical of the era which was a definite downgrade. The series finds a married Tommy and Tuppence taking over a detective agency and assuming the pseudonym of the jailed original owner of the Agency, Mr. Blunt while Tuppence pretends to be his confidential secretary, Miss Robinson. The stories are set in the 1920s and the producers do a great job creating a period feel, even on a limited budget. Annis carries the show in that regard, looking very much the fashionable 1920s woman in looks as well as her general manner.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The book upon which the series was based, was a bit of a tongue in cheek look at popular detective fiction and that feel comes through with several tips of the cap to the great detectives while maintaining a light feel to most stories. The pacing could be a bit slow with too much melodrama and lead to a resolution that was more than a little bit rushed. There were some great episodes in the series, but some stinkers as well. The best episodes in the series are arguably the last two, &#34;The Case of the Missing Lady&#34; (from a comedy standpoint) and &#34;The Cracker&#34; from adramatic standpoint with &#34;The House of Lurking Death&#34; probably the weakest.<|SEP|><|SEP|>In the end, the series is worth watching because of the delightful performance of Annis and her chemistry with Warwick. While not a great show, like many other programs of bygone days, it will beat most of what's on television these days."

However, by the end of the movie, I found that my melancholy emotions (as I have been affected, although indirectly, stricken with the same illness protagonist Jack is battling) were dwarfed by this films sense of adventure. There is an intangible about this film that just makes me want to re-live my younger years as a Yankee fan and have the same strong aspirations as Jack. This is a great film, for kids and adults alike, that teaches the invaluable lesson that know matter what hardships arise, with the right people by your side, you can choose to have the strength that makes you overcome. One thing this movie lacked was more of my own personal favorite Yankees. All in all, the message in this film was clear."

I decided to give this one a try. After the first night, I was not impressed. It seemed awkward and each time I shifted during the night, I had to think about how I was supposed to position my head. I decided that one night was probably not sufficient test time for this pillow. I have slept on it 5 nights now and I really like it. The support for my back is great and just what I was looking for.

The boat is hard to capsize on smooth, calm water; however, it flips over easily in rough water. The hull seems very durable.

Highly Recommended!,"I was skeptical when I purchased this Chalkseries Chalkboard contact paper because I have already bought my fair share of disappointing generic chalkboard contact papers- the thin flimsy ones that don't hold chalk nearly as well as they are supposed to. However, I decided to take a chance with this one although it is more pricey than the generic Con-Tact brand.<|SEP|><|SEP|>As almost always with FBA, the items arrived within 3 days. The retail box looks amazing- the company definitely put some great thought into it.<|SEP|><|SEP|>I cut an 18 inches x 2 feet portion and applied this on my bedroom wall. I instantly realized that this chalkboard contact paper is different from the rest- it has a much thicker material (which later on I will find to be the main reason why this product is superior). I was able to apply it perfectly without leaving any air bubbles trapped underneath.<|SEP|><|SEP|>After using this for 2 days, there are a few things I can comment on in detail.<|SEP|><|SEP|>1. It holds chalk EXTREMELY well and when you erase with a dry cloth, almost all the chalk marks are removed. NONE of the chalkboard contact papers I have previously used comes close to the quality of this product.<|SEP|><|SEP|>2. No ""scratch"" marks are left behind even when you do write hard.<|SEP|><|SEP|>3. If you want to ""reset"" the chalkboard, wipe it with a damp cloth, and your chalkboard will look absolutely brand new. Not a single smudge will be left behind.<|SEP|><|SEP|>In conclusion, I admit that it's obvious that I have nothing but praises for this product. I would give this product a 9.5 out of 10, only because I wish it was as cheap as the generic contact papers out there! But I guess it is true that you get what you pay for. When all is said and done, this product is DEFINITELY worth buying if you are fed up with chalkboard contact papers that are mediocre!"

13103,__label2__,3,Y,Camera,B002C6QE00,Kenko 1.4X PRO 300 Teleconverter DGX Nikon AF Digital SLRs,Okay for Casual Use,"I'll admit I'm not a huge fan of using TC's generally speaking but my opinion has been based on shooting film from decades ago. I wondered if maybe technology had caught up and if today's tele-converters were better than the ones I remembered. I ordered the Kenko after reading several reviews figuring for the price, I can't get hurt too badly. My experience with the Kenko 1.4x did not impress me. Build quality seemed good. Not great, but good. The TC fit well on my D750 with no discernible &#34;play&#34;. With a lens attached there was a tiny wiggle. The TC works best with Nikon lenses; but this should not be surprising. What was a little surprising was just how bad the image quality was when used in conjunction with a non-Nikon lens. Using the Kenko with my Sigma 50mm f/1.4 Art series lens, for example, was a complete disaster. Used with a Nikon 85mm f/1.8G image sharpness was clearly degraded but still very acceptable. Chromatic aberration was apparent however and that kind of bugged me. Yes, I can remove with Photoshop but I prefer not having it to begin with. Auto-focus generally seemed to &#34;flutter&#34; and struggle a bit, even in full sunlight, but focus-lock did happen. In summary, I'd say this is a pretty mediocre piece of kit. I won't be keeping mine but I'm really picky about my image quality. For more casual shooters, this is probably a nice addition to the bag. For the serious hobbyist or pro shooter, however, I'd have to say the Kenko 1.4x Pro 300 DGX is probably a non-starter."

One way Roku could improve the channel experience would be to aggregate movies across all channels you're subscribed to, subdividing into pay-vs-free so that you'd have essentially one &#34;Roku channel&#34; that de-duplicates movies.

I believe it to be crucially important for students (young & old) to begin music making doing just that - playing as much as possible first without being encumbered too much by reading lots of notation. The CD recording is very good in that it starts students playing using a G tuning thereby allowing music making to be virtually immediate. However, as matters progress to standard tuning, the recording provides notes that are 1/2 flat of concert pitch (Eb, Ab, Db, Gb, Bb, Eb instead of E, A, D, G, B, E)! Odd, especially considering that the G tuning IS at correct pitch. Publisher needs to correct this ASAP!"

When wearing glasses with wider temples it is more comfortable to rest them on the top edge of the muffs rather than under the ear cushions. There is no adjustment for fit other than raising or lowering the earmuffs from the headband. It would have been better if the headband was adjustable for width; if you have a larger than average head these might be just too tight.<|SEP|><|SEP|>These come with foam ear cushions and are replaceable at a reasonable price.

I started taking it in the evenings, when I take my other vitamins. I did notice that for the first few nights I had a minor headache, but that passed within a week. Obviously there is no immediately noticeable effect, but around the end of week 2 I started to notice a subtle difference in my ability to focus, stay on task and handle surprises. Like other reviewers have indicated, this is not a magic pill that creates a dramatic moment—no switch flipped, if you follow me. I've been struggling to find the words to explain it. Before HCF, if I I was easily distracted from task on hand. After HCF, I just do the task—no great epiphany, I am just able to focus on what needs to be done and do it without the distractions. I find that my general outlook is a little bit sunnier—I’m not as inclined to become exasperated by changes of plans and find it a little easier to go with the flow.

We found it has some nice features, but I'm not sure if it will end up being something that's used continuously.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The magnification works well, and it works for both close-up jobs (like removing something from an eye) and makeup. She also liked the different lighting options. It's amazing how different the same look appears under various types of lighting. The styling was so-so, and a bit bulky to just leave on the vanity. The description talks about using it for travel, but I'm not quite sure I'd want to mess with it in a suitcase. The side mirrors fold down with no securing mechanism, so that's not very convenient if you move it on and off the vanity. As noted in other reviews, the item that seems to make the least sense is that the bulbs can't be replaced. You're basically risking a $60 purchase on a $2 light bulb.<|SEP|><|SEP|>While it's a ""nice to have"" item, it's not something we'd purchase on our own.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Disclosure:<|SEP|>Obtained From: Amazon Vine Review Program<|SEP|>Payment: Free"

Imagine my surprise when Angie unrolled two big tunnels that had been in the box and left them on the floor for me to explore as well. I sniffed at the dangling toys at the entrance and crawled inside the big tunnel. It makes a VERY satisfying rustle when I move through it, which is fun, and it has a window in the middle that lets me peek out at the people. I enjoyed exploring the tunnel and then capped off the experience by settling inside for a nice nap.<|SEP|>The small tunnel didn’t interest me too much, but I’m a BIG cat, and kittens might enjoy it more. I might even let my sister Rikki play with it so that she’ll leave MY BIG tunnel alone.<|SEP|>I get bored with even the best toys after a while, so Angie puts them away until they are likely to pique my interest again. The big tunnel has three hook-and-loop mechanisms to hold the tunnel shut when it is folded, which makes it easy to store, and the little tunnel can be secured shut using the loop on the dangling toy. The tunnels look well-made, and I think we'll have them to play with for a long time.<|SEP|>All in all, this was that rare Amazon delivery where I’d rate the contents higher than the box. Since the boxes themselves are usually five-star items, in my opinion, these tunnels certainly deserve the highest rating. I am sure discriminating cats in your household will agree!"

It has for me. If you haven't already looked at this you should: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FLUB76?tag=i60-20 Something to beware of: Tool manufacturers to include those of flashlights are stamping items &#34;&#34;U.S.A.&#34;&#34; vs &#34;&#34;Made in U.S.A.&#34;&#34; due to some or most of a widget's parts/build process being performed offshore then in some fashion assembled in USA. About the set: Heavy steel; lengths: 12&#34;&#34; OAL w/a ~2.1&#34;&#34; jaw drop, 9.5&#34;&#34;OAL w/a ~ 1.2&#34;&#34; jaw drop, and 6.75&#34;&#34;OAL w/a ~ 0.75&#34;&#34; jaw drop while closed; very good thick rubber-type handle coverings which actually feel thicker than my 40-y/o set (could be due to wear); exposed metal has some sort of heavy lacquer finish for corrosion prevention, something I don't recall on old set; water pump pivot pin is a big rivet vs lag bolt w/ self-locking nut...Hmmm, I personally like those w/ self-locking nut (older ones same size have) but perhaps the larger size pumps made today have lags/SL nuts, not sure. The `apex' screwdriver is stamped &#34;&#34;CHANNELLOCK&#34;&#34; which means something in itself; has a 'corn cob' handle -- it's beefy by comparison and should perform well esp with longer high-carbon cross-tip bits. If you're a picky B when it comes to hand tools, I think you'll like this set. Update: Something's odd with screwdriver (shaft pulls from handle - I finally figure out lol). It has a reversible 5/16 inch bit (Phillips/flat) which has a receiver ball to remain attached. And, apparently a bit with same type receiver ball (1/4inch bit) must be used on opposing side (ordinary bits fall right out lol)...hmmm"

11439,__label2__,5,N,Toys,B00BQYQYHC,Fisher-Price Roll N Go Get Away Garage,Best gift this year for our almost 3yo (he's able to use it all by himself too!),"This was a christmas gift for our almost 3yo son from his aunt - He LOVED it - all present opening stopped for about 30 minutes since he simply could not wait for us to get this out of the box so he could play with it - we had to let him play with ½ of it b/c he was so excited!! It was hands down the best gift this year. It did take his dad a few minutes to assemble (like 10 minutes maybe) - but once put together it's worked almost flawlessly - my son LOVES using the elevator (& closing the gate every time) - then taking the car over with the crane - & he was able to use all of this entirely on his own after the first time we showed him.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The only thing about this that could be designed a bit better would be the police car ramp (at the top of the elevator there's a ramp that holds a car - it's designed so when the car in the elevator is released onto the top level that ramp releases the car it's holding - so you end up with the police car chasing the yellow car). It's a bit of a pain to load - I have to use both hands to keep the release in place (since otherwise the ramp doesn't stay up) - or I have to hold it up while my son puts it in. This is the only bit he struggle to do on his own (he gets lucky every once in a while though).<|SEP|><|SEP|>The pull out extension of the road on the bottom level is kinda weird - not sure why it's even necessary & can be a bit uncooperative at times when it comes to getting it back in - but it's not like that has any effect on the overall functionality of this product. I will admit - I am concerned about how long the crane will last - the spring is quite strong - so when my son pulls it over to the other level it snaps back quite quickly. Not concerned about it hurting my son - but am concerned that it will eventually crack the molded plastic or something....we'll see.<|SEP|><|SEP|>But overall we're totally thrilled with this toy - as is my son. Even we've had fun playing with this thing...it's great. I imagine there may be some people who get some duds - whenever you involve mass production of molded plastic & a lot of little moving parts, that happens - but fisher price has always been pretty good at providing replacements for us when this has happened (can't speak to this specific product - but if you have trouble with yours I suggest just contacting fisher price - they'll probably send you a new one).

The price on this may have gone up some, I bought one some time ago. This is a VERY GOOD strap. One of the frequent problems with such items is that the metal is often a very low quality, planned obsolescence type of metal that I believe is called &#34;pot metal&#34;, almost something like metal manufacturing leftover scrap materials, and the mechanism when a strap is made of that will tend to bend out of shape or break, or bend out of shape and then break when you bend it back.<|SEP|><|SEP|>I bought this strap back more than a year and a half ago. I am kind of rough as far as loading a bag up a lot and was using the strap to often walk four miles a day to a bus plus sometimes hanging groceries off the bag on the way back. What I say then is not typical entirely typical use But the strap lasted and lasted and lasted in spite of my putting great strain on it. It lasted a lot longer than any strap I had ever had, perhaps about a year and a half or more, when straps usually gave out on me in, perhaps, two months. One day it broke. I had overpacked my bag and then had additional materials hanging from it.<|SEP|><|SEP|>This may sound silly, but I actually felt saddened, because I had been able to depend upon this strap like no other.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Then the thought occurred to me to check on whether there was a guarantee. There was, and although I had to mail the strap in to them, they promptly, courteously, without question or grumbling fixed it.<|SEP|><|SEP|>If you are an actor or actress in a movie and pretending to carry something for a scene, you will not need this strap. But if you have to depend on a strap to carry a bit of weight and you need for it to last, I highly recommend this strap.<|SEP|><|SEP|>And if you ARE an actor or actress in a movie and pretending to carry something for a scene, try to get the producer to supply you with this strap with the stipulation that you will be allowed to take it home."
10580,__label2__,5,Y,Pet Products,B000795XMY,K&H Manufacturing Deluxe Kitty Sill With Bolster Tan Kitty Print 14-Inch by 24-Inch,Wonderful perch!,"We recently adopted a cat wanted to start with a few items to make her comfortable. Remembering how much the cats I had as a kid loved sitting in the window, this seemed like it would be a good fit. When it arrived, my first impression was that it was easy to assemble and install, looked attractive, and seemed very comfortable. Under the cover is a layer of egg-crate style foam with what seems to be a waterproof layer over that. Then comes the actual cover and bolster. The cover is soft and plush and the bolster is covered with a smooth fabric. This all fits over a plastic frame. While the frame doesn't feel overly heavy-duty, it does seem adequate. Our cat is pretty small, only about six pounds, so I can't say how this would hold up to a 20 pound cat.<|SEP|><|SEP|>There are two ways to install this. You can use the enclosed screws and simply screw them into the window sill. Slide the cover over and you're done. This is what we did. Also, there are two velcro strips, though I can't say how they would work. I would imagine the tapes from Command hooks could be a possibility for damage-free installation, too. The velcro (and Command tapes) need to sit for a time before you use the product.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The bolster is always shown on the window side, which seems backward to me, but you can put the cover on with the bolster either side. The bolster also zips off. Our cat likes to sit on the perch, back away from the window against the bolster. She seems quite comfortable, spends a lot of time there, and has made herself comfortable in her new home. We are happy with our decision and would highly recommend this product."

They do in fact work. What is unfortunate is the the input and output segments for your standard aquarium hose are way to big. I was not able to get my hoses very far up the valve. I was disappointed with that. What I had to do was get some hot water and dip the ends of the tube to soften up the plastic and then attempt to shove them on. Luckily that helped a little and when they contracted in size, it basically created a vacuum and sealed them onto the valve. I would have given them a 1 star but since I got it to work, I felt it was not fair...3 stars at most."

1368,__label1__,1,N,Grocery,B00O41OKEI,ONE ORGANIC Matcha Green Tea Powder (250g) - USDA Certified Organic,One star - I am worried about lead contamination in matcha from China.,"Lead contamination of matcha is a real problem in China! I understand that lead has been entering the River Yangtze and East China Sea as a result of poor industrial waste disposal regulations and practices in China (Huh and Chen 1999). Water irrigations systems for farms obtain water from the River Yangtze! As a result the tea plants do get contaminated with lead. Even organic farms in China are at risk. In 2006 Han et al showed that 32% of 1225 tea samples from China contained lead at levels that exceed the maximum permissible concentration. In 2013 Consumer Lab dot com advised people not to consume matcha from China until you are sure about the purity of the matcha! The only way to be sure about the purity of the matcha is to see a lab report on the amount of lead in the matcha. Lead can damage any organ in the body including the brain, causing learning and behavioural problems and also problems with doing arithmetic or language problems.<|SEP|>I think it is important that a lab report on lead content of the matcha is uploaded on to Amazon by one organic as it is a matter of food safety. Until then I will not drink this matcha which clearly says on the back of the pack that it is a ""Product of China”. It is an important issue. Once I have seen the lab report on Amazon I will write what I thought about the appearance and taste of this matcha.<|SEP|><|SEP|>It is useful to read ""SCALE AND CAUSES OF LEAD CONTAMINATION IN CHINESE TEA” and the Consumer Lab dot com article which you can find online.

13966,__label2__,5,N,Books,1502436736,The 3rd American Dream: That is Global in Reach,"Inspiring, informative, practical. An essential for anybody with ambition.","As I read through Sharma's &#34;The 3rd American Dream,&#34; I found myself nodding at every page. His book - perhaps more aptly described as a treatise - is a masterful analysis of the past, present, and future of the elusive ideal we have come to know as &#34;The American Dream.&#34; His core message to ambitious Americans is clear: times are changing, and if we wish to seize the American Dream, we must all be prepared for it.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Sharma himself mentions that the book - while age-independent - is tailored for younger generations. As a college student myself, I found his text to be surprisingly refreshing and accessible, considering the heavy topics it discusses. This was a welcome change of pace, since I was so accustomed to stale academic textbooks that spent far too much time discussing abstract theories, rather than synthesizing coherent lessons and offering practical advice.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Indeed, &#34;The 3rd American Dream&#34; is a practical text. In Sharma's own words: &#34;You must have a vision - but remember - one lives by the day.&#34; It reads like a narrative while maintaining a solid focus on weaving together important topics to dispense valuable advice for entrepreneurs, students, investors - indeed all Americans with a goal in mind and the heart to pursue it.<|SEP|><|SEP|>As a young American, I see the truth of Sharma's words DAILY resonating throughout our society. He discusses the unique, innovative atmosphere of the American people, the paradigm-shifting importance of the woman-operated enterprise as a vehicle for gender equality, the necessity for an infrastructure that facilitates the growth and development of future Americans, the various global superpowers (India, China, the USA, etc) and the industries they dominate, the various emerging trends in business...and so much more. And he never sacrifices depth for breadth; like a skilled diver, he plunges into each topic and surfaces with a new pearl of practical wisdom, backed by research andpersonal experience.<|SEP|><|SEP|>This text is an essential read for any reader who understands the thrilling pursuit of the American dream. It equips readers with the historical knowledge they need to understand their place in history, the practical business knowledge they need to navigate the market place, and the motivational message that, if we take charge of our lives and make conscious, predictive decisions, we can realize the 3rd American Dream, turning the United States into - in Sharma's own words - &#34;the path to infinite prosperity.&#34;<|SEP|>Inspiring. A must-read. I highly recommend it."

10839,__label2__,4,N,Books,803738552,Counting by 7s,A beautiful story - a no spoilers review,"This is one of the most beautiful stories I've read in a long time. It's about a 12 year old girl named Willow who looks and acts different from typical girls her age. She's a genius but the quirks don't stop there. She gets joy out of counting by sevens and is obsessed with medical symptoms and diagnoses of diseases. After disaster strikes, Willow has to find a way to cope with the motley group of people she unexpectedly finds herself among.<|SEP|><|SEP|>This book has all the making of a Newbery gold medalist: strong character development, a lovable and unique protagonist, a death (but it happens early so it's not a depressing book), well written prose and unexpected hilarious moments interspersed. I really enjoyed it and hope it gets at least some recognition by way of awards.<|SEP|><|SEP|>That said, even though I think it's an excellent book, I am dubious that the target age group would enjoy it. The beginning is slow and, due to the early death, was hard to get into. There were days I didn't want to pick it up because I didn't want to read about grieving. Once I got past that, I was eager to open its pages. But I can't help but think that adolescents would not be as tenacious with their reading. Also, there aren't any heart-racing moments where the excitement peaks. This is a book to savor and to relish, not to grip with white knuckled fingers at 2am.<|SEP|><|SEP|>But personally for me, an adult, I was enchanted by it and am glad to have read it.<|SEP|><|SEP|>P.S I know I mentioned the death but since the product description mentions it, I didn't consider it a spoiler."

After looking at a lot of products offered and the reviews on Amazon as well as other sites, I settled on this set. Personally, I am very happy with my choice. The knives are very sharp and they do their job well. The knives are very light in weight but I personally don't feel that has an effect on their performance. I think if you want anything fancier you would have to spend hundreds of dollars for a professional set, which of course not everyone wants to do. I am someone who cooks in the kitchen 6 days a week and I have not been disappointed by any of these knives. They meet my needs perfectly fine. I should note that the block set comes with a couple of extra slots so I purchased the Wusthof Gourment Santoku and vegetable knifes so that the block would be full. The Santoku knife does not come with this set but it is my favorite knife because it serves many cutting purposes. Overall I would say I recommend this to anyone looking for good quality knife set but not wanting to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars."

I find the quality of the bands to be really good. The bands have bright colors, and you get a lot of colors in the deluxe kit. The bands are soft, odorless, the have a good stretch which makes it easier for me to do complex designs. The hooks are alright. I do prefer s-clips over c-clips. The loom itself is really good. It's sturdy and not flimsy. You can extend the looms to any length just keep attaching more looms.<|SEP|><|SEP|>As far as i'm concerned with the many brands I've tried for looms, Inifity loom bands are on top.

Nobody has to play the role of Dungeon Master, because the encounter/instructions tell you what all the monsters do, who they go after, etc. It is also random each time, because the way you place the board tiles and draw cards, it makes it different.

I used them to better manage the LP4 power requirements for 2x EVGA GeForce GTX 970 Superclocked ACX 2.0 4GB video cards (for SLI). the videocards require FOUR LP4 power connections EACH! so 8 total. YES 8! I ordered four of these and they cut the requirement in half so I only had to use ONE LP4 power cable (1xCorsair PSU power cable with 4 LP4 connectors), and they worked great. I was concerned they might not because the Video cards included cables (black ones in the picture) only had three pins, and these had four pins. But they work exactly as I hoped! Pictures below, my new PC build. I'm planning to sleeve these cables soon possibly. My new builds part list made with PC part picker: http://pcpartpicker.com/user/Egyptian/saved/XQcBD3"

And Duke, always and forever into something shady, gives a hand when he isn't learning about his dead father. This is a great, adult, sci-fi series.

A few hours later, Emma learns that Joanna's daughter Lainey is in a mental health facility after three attempts to commit suicide. Lainey and Emma's own daughter are good friends, so Emma pays the young woman a visit. After the talk, Emma thinks that a ghost might be involved in Lainey's attempts on her own life. But is it Max or someone else? Can Emma figure out the cause in time to keep Lainey safe? I've enjoyed the previous two books in this series, and this was the strongest yet. The characters, both living and ghostly, are vivid and pull you into the story. There were times some of the characters were doing some stupid things, but even then I usually felt sorry for them. The plot moves forward on two levels involving the present and the past. Both mysteries are compelling, although I usually found myself more involved in the modern mystery. Yet the historic mystery packed a real emotional punch in the end. There was a sub-plot I didn't like because Emma was being stupid and complicating her life. I'll be looking forward to seeing how that gets resolved in future books. This is a compelling read with great characters that will keep you turning pages until you reach the end."
16246,__label2__,2,N,Books,805083383,Book by Book: Notes on Reading and Life,What is the purpose of this creepy book?,"Michael Dirda was for years (decades?) a critic for the Washington Post Book World. I was aware of this, and also that he was given endless latitude in selecting his topics. This is the first (and definitely last) book of his that I have read, discovering it at my local library branch sitting on a table. With a quote from TLS and a reminder that he has a Pulitzer for criticism, it sounded like a promising read.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Boy did I loath this book! I awarded it 2 stars simply because I reserve 1 star for books that are horribly written, which this isn't. There is nothing technically wrong with the writing. The author can write a sentence and string several together in a paragraph. No, I hated this book for the creepy tone and the all-knowing blather. Call this a self-help book for the intellectually insecure.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The assumption behind this book seems to be that there are hordes of people eager to read but utterly clueless about what they should read. Yes, should read, not want to read. This is reading as something between castor oil and self-improvement, and reeks of the same white male well-educated superiority that was so popular in the 1950s. If you liked Adler's Great Books, this is the book for you! But even Adler limited his all-knowingness to the intellectual realm, instructing the rest of us what we should read. Not Dirda! Nope, in addition to endless lists of books we Should Read, he has advice on seemingly all other aspects of life. ""When we consider the ways we might spend our leisure hours...we shouldn't overlook or neglect hobbies and pets."" ""Though books can obviously help create a holiday spirit, do not neglect traditional activities. Listen to Christmas songs on the radio. Go caroling...""<|SEP|><|SEP|>There are over a hundred ""literary"" quotes that the author has lovingly saved up over a lifetime just waiting, apparently, for an opportunity to foist them upon his starved for education readers. I'm sorry, but it simply doesn'twork. One simply can't flit between single sentence quotes of Hobbes, Henry James and Cocteau and benefit from the sampling.

When I was comparing cameras, I also looked at the 2013 version of this camera the HX-30V and found them to be more or less the same, with the exception of maybe a little bit better version of zoom on the 30-V, however the 2013 version of this camera costs 70 to 100 dollars more than this one. So if the 20 x zoom is worth the difference in price versus the 16x on this one, then go for the 30-v, but if not, then this is a good choice that takes good pictures and is reasonably priced."

I've probably used more than 100 in my desktops and light use servers and that many again in client desktops/servers. My overall experience has been excellent and this drive, so far, is no exception.<|SEP|><|SEP|>After a week with the WD2003FZEX my first impressions are below. I'll update the review as I've lived with the drive for a while and share what I learn.<|SEP|><|SEP|>I installed the WD2003FZEX 2TB WD Black drive into a Dell T7500 Precision Workstation. It is being used for data and is not the boot drive which is a [[ASIN:B00CKAOWB6 Seagate 600 series SSD]] that is very fast but power hungry for a SSD: good for desktops, not as much for laptops/tablets.<|SEP|><|SEP|>I tried both the built-in SATA2 and an add-in card with SATA3. In all cases Installation was painless and uneventful. The different interfaces did not yield dramatically different results.<|SEP|><|SEP|>To get an handle on how this drive's performance changes from the last version I ran some tests on this drive and a older [[ASIN:B004CSIFFS Caviar Black 750 GB SATA III 7200 RPM 64MB - WD7502AAEX]] for comparison.<|SEP|><|SEP|>In running casual tests (copying large files, directories of small files, etc.) I got some general impressions of the drive:<|SEP|><|SEP|>1) In both large files and small file copies to/from the FZEX outperforms the older AAEX but mostly shines with small file/random access. I believe the improvement for small file/random access is close to 10%. Some of this might be the dual processor and improved caching over older versions.<|SEP|><|SEP|>2) it's more noisy than previous versions as has been noted in other reviews. It seems that is a fairly consistent pattern for rotating media drives: faster=noisier.<|SEP|><|SEP|>3) The drive runs slightly warm - meaning comfortably warm to the touch. Good for longevity and unusual for a performance drive.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The WD Black line of drives comes with a 5 year warranty. I have had few failues with WD drives but when they have happened I have never had a problem with warranty. This has not been so true with other manufacturers (You can read about this in my review of the [[ASIN:B00691WMJG Seagate Momentus XT 750GB Hybrid Drive]]). With a business where I run a lot of hard drives this matters. Warranty is nothing until you need it, then it's everything.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The FZEX is a consistent step in the long evolution and ongoing improvement of the WD Black line drives. For consistent quality I have to give this drive 5 stars.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Hope this paints a helpful picture of what the drive delivers.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Update: Dec 27, 2013<|SEP|><|SEP|>After living with the 2TB black drive for a while it seems more quiet than at first. This might be the drive, but I think more likely me just getting used to it. So far no issues or glitches. It is operating perfectly and still feels faster than my older WD Black line drives. I'm still quite satisfied.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Another option from WD that is a little unusual and works in laptops and may also be good for compact desktops or all-in-one's is the [[ASIN:B00GSJ9X4Q Black2 Dual Drive 2.5&#34; 120 GB SSD + 1 TB HDD]]. This provides an OS sized 120GB SSD and 1TB HDD in one laptop sized package. This is different from hybrid drives. It uses one 2.5&#34; format package to implement the popular desktop combo of a SSD for the OS and a conventional drive for bulk data. It's on the expensive side but is a good solution for a combination of speed and bulk data. I installed this for a client who does video editing on a laptop."

11200,__label2__,5,N,Electronics,B009JBZFVK,Onkyo A-9050 Integrated Stereo Amplifier (Black),"Great integrated amplifier, and huge value! Get a good pair of speakers and you're 'all set'!","I sure do miss the glory days of hi-fi, when high quality stereo receivers, preamplifiers, amplifiers, and true speaker systems ruled the day! Now everything is miniaturized and portable, with sound quality often suffering bigtime. Sure MP3 files, iPODs, iPADs, and PC's (with their small speakers) are convenient ways to get (download) and carry music around with you, but you're missing out on palpable bass, a natural soundstage, and musical detail when you listen to most pairs of compromised headphones or PC speakers, sadly typical of most music listening done today. Do yourselves a big favor- if you truly love music and you wish to listen to music in all it's grandness and glory, get a good integrated amplifier (or separates- preamp and amp combo), and a great set of speakers to hook up your digital files player or PC to. Your ears will thank you! Contrary to belief, you really don't have to spend a fortune if you know what to look for. Knowledge is power, and equates to savings too. The great thing about this integrated amp is that it already has an excellent built-in Wolfson DAC, and Onkyo is a respected name in audio going back decades. I just helped my neighbor (college student) select his very first stereo system with conventional speakers, and I suggested this integrated amp. He also wanted a pair of good bookshelf speakers, and he ended up with JBL ES30's. His budget was $700, which was met (including RCA to mini-plug stereo cable and a short run of thick speaker wire). We were both floored when we listened to some of his higher-res digital files through the Onkyo and JBL's!

Then I was surprised by the goose neck which I did not notice by the Amazon images, my fault. It's straight from the 1950s the whole makeup. Plus that goose neck is quite stiff and not so flexible as one might think from the images. The electric cord was also surprise, I had assumed the LED lamp worked with batteries.

13119,__label2__,5,Y,Kitchen,B0047QOUCC,Trudeau Stainless Steel Ricer with 2 Blades,Does what it's supposed to,"I had to give this some serious thoughts and considerations before buying this product because of the very low review given by a popular test kithcen. I almost didn't buy it... I actually bought others including the oxo ricer with three settings. The others had their share of flaws. However, the Trudeau ricer really came through and did what I need it to do. That is to rice potatoes and to make noodles with their two blades. The hopper was a decent size, it has a swivel head that adjusts as it pushes food down through the blades, this adjusustable head has the perfect size fitting the hopper keeping the food down the hopper and out instead of getting pushed back upward, and the handle is comfortable to use. Another concern I had after reading the review was having food left over in the hopper because of a gap due to design flaw... Well, there was no gap. All the food in the hopper was pushed out through the holes leaving no wastes. I like this product. I'm especially happy that the risk I took in buying this product was worth my while."

I have a TiVo HD and PS3 Slim input into the str-dn1030 via HDMI. The str-dn1030 outputs to a wall hung 42"" Panasonic Plasma via HDMI. I have internet connected to it via Ethernet. I operate my A/V system with a Harmony 900 (fully RF).<|SEP|><|SEP|>The str-dn1030 connected to a 5.1 system and the automatic speaker calibration feature (via the included mic) was very smooth and easy. I really enjoy the sound quality of this unit. The music and sound effects from the opening bank robbery sequence in The Dark Knight (on Bluray) were simply lovely.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Video is beautiful.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The GUI on the str-dn1030 is almost laughably bad looking and unintuitive, but is perfectly functional with the assistance of the user manual. I am truly perplexed at how bad the GUI is given how Sony can clearly deliver a better product. Perhaps this will be improved in a future firmware update. All this being said, I find the str-dn1030's bad GUI is better than the no GUI on my old Panasonic Receiver.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The delay in getting an image from the PS3 or TiVo to my Panny 42"" display upon initially powering on the unit, or when switching inputs, was initially jarring for me. It isn't ridiculously long, but definitely noticeable compared to the near instantaneous sound and signal transmission I had enjoyed with my video outputs going directly to the display (via HDMI) and my audio outputs going directly to my old receiver (via Optical).<|SEP|><|SEP|>FYI, an inactivity power off feature appeared to have been enabled by default at the factory with my unit. I thought I was initially going crazy when watching Netflix Instant streaming when the str-dn1030 ""spontaneously"" powered off on my several times in a row. Sure enough the unit was set to power off automatically after a period of inactivity (10 minutes if I recall correctly).<|SEP|><|SEP|>I love the str-dn1030's bluetoothaudio streaming function. Especially where the str-dn1030 fires up instantly from standby as soon as you ""connect"" a paired device via bluetooth. I discovered another tricky spot with the user manual. The glossary refers you to page 101 for Bluetooth Pairing...don't fall for it! Go to page 82 instead.<|SEP|><|SEP|>I think the build quality of the unit is very good and overall I'm very pleased with the daily functioning of this device."

Drill a 3/8 hole for the anchors, NOT the slightly larger M10 that is recommended in the instructions. I drilled 3/8 with intentions to enlarge the hole from there but found the anchors fit almost loose in the smaller hole and any larger would have been a problem.

19538,__label2__,5,Y,Lawn and Garden,B002SAUQW2,"DuroMax Elite MX4500, 3500 Running Watts/4500 Starting Watts, Gas Powered Portable Generator",Generator works great and at a good price,"I bought the MX4500 for the occasional storm outage. My considerations were: noise, wattage, run-time, weight, cost. I wanted to run my well pump, two refrigerators, and a propane furnace (i.e. blower). While I can't run everything at the same time, I was able to hook up quite a bit more by also buying a transfer switch. I STRONGLY recommend the transfer switch for safety and a more practical use of the generator. It allows me (or my wife) to easily hookup the generator and turn circuits on/off (upto 10 circuits for our switch) based on maximum wattage.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Noise: after trying to sleep with the noise from the neighbor's generator running several hundred feet away, I wanted something quiter. The MX4500 is reasonable (similar to a small pushmower). From inside the house, I am not aware of the unit running.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Weight: I wanted something me and my wife could carry (or load in the trunk of the car) if necessary. While it's not light, we were able to carry it together. By storing it in the garage, my wife can easily roll it to where the transfer box plug is on the side of the house, hook it up and start it (without my help!).<|SEP|><|SEP|>Wattage: of all circuits, my 1/2 HP well pump draws the highest wattage at a MAX of 3000W startup surge (according to the manufacturer). Once the pump is running, it only draws about 1000W. Once the water pressure tank is filled, of course there is no draw. With that in mind, a transfer switch allows me to easily turn the well pump on and off when I need it; e.g. to take a shower or refill the pressure tank. While the well pump is turned on, I don't use any power hungry devices. Beware of surge wattage - the refrigerators surge when they start, the furnace blower surges etc. During the last outage: I ran the well pump when needed, cooked dinner in the microwave, then ran a room air conditioner with several rooms of lighting and the refrigerators. This was the only time so far I have run the unit for an extendedperiod of time. If I recall correctly, it ran for 7 to 8 hours on one tank.<|SEP|><|SEP|>If noise, weight and cost were not considerations, I would have bought an 8,000 Watt generator to run everything without having to switch things on and off. With the transfer switch already in place, I could easily do that at a future time. Considering how rarely we lose power, the price point of this unit was just right.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Additional comment about the transfer switch, I was a little apprehensive of installing the transfer switch on my own, but it was fairly easy. I read the instructions carefully before hand and then took a few hours for the install. The model is a Reliance Pro/Tran 10 circuit 30 amp switch. (It included the cable to hookup to the generator, the outdoor connection box etc.)<|SEP|><|SEP|>I haven't had the unit for very long and have only started it 4 or 5 times. Each time, it started on the first or second pull. As with most engines that sit for a long time (snowblower etc), I turn the gas valve off and let the gas run out before storing the unit. With how infrequent I expect to use this, I also use gas stabilizer.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Overall, I am very happy with this generator. It does exactly what I needed at a very reasonable cost."

The cinematography in his movies I Saw the Devil and The Good, The Bad, and the Weird is simply some of the best cinematography I've seen in any movie anywhere (American movies included). If you don't mind subtitles (and you shouldn't) check both of those out.<|SEP|><|SEP|>So I was excited that Mr. Kim's American debut was going to be Arnold's return to the big screen. The previews looked promising and fun. But something about the movie just felt...off. None of the action sequences were all that impressive or original, and you certainly don't go buying a movie like this for the plot and characters. it also seemed like some of the risks and insane cinematography that the director had shown in some of his previous movies was absent.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Overall, it's not bad, but if you really want to be entertained, check out the aforementioned Korean movies by Jee-woon Kim."

12205,__label2__,3,N,Books,802408796,Before Burnout: Balanced Living for Busy People (Christian living),Don't Get Burned by Following Jesus,"The authors in Before Burnout deal with perfectionistic attitudes and behavior. It is interesting that Minirth and Meier write so much about perfectionism and burnout, when they freely admit that they themselves are perfectionists or obsessive-compulsive. This gives the books a personal touch, however, since they sprinkle personal examples throughout their writings. They describe two kinds of perfectionists: the quality and the quantity characters. Like their former volume, How to Beat Burnout, the biblical Martha gets the bad rap. Unlike the former volume, this one contains no references to sources of information and studies cited. Though this might make for easier reading, the academic might be frustrated, especially when he or she needs more convincing. Sometimes it appears that the authors characterize just plain Christian spirituality, truth, and accuracy as obsessive-compulsive (OC) (p. 29). Even Moses gets labeled an OC (p. 52). They appear to assume that middle-class values, i.e. people who tend to work long hours, are really OCs (p. 61), and even characterize those with a high need for achievement as OCs (p. 68). Their psychologizing of Calvin's theology (p. 71) reminds me of Erik Erikson's description of Lutheran theology as ""anal repulsive."" (Luther was sitting on the pot when the doctrine of justification by faith broke through upon him.) As in the preceding book, idealism, unrealistic expectations, bitterness and forgiveness are primary themes for recovery. Yet some of their recommendations appear awkward. They want their clients to choose friendships that will benefit themselves (p. 134), somewhat reversing Christ's command to love our enemies. And the later chapters of their book appears only loosely tied to OC or perfectionistic behavior."

It's replacing a Samsung UN46D6050TFXZA which was also purchased at Costco's. I generally like Samsung products. I have 5 TV's and 2 phones from them. This was the 2nd time in 4 years, the UN46D6050 went bad, (hhmmm, maybe a lemon? not sure...) so I decided to try something different.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Price wise, it was perfect. After taxes, it was $481. About $150 cheaper than a Samsung. The picture quality, is ok. It's not as sharp/clear as a Samsung, even on the HDMI input. My mom isn't real picky about that. She's just happy that her TV is working again. I haven't connected it to the router yet. It's a little too far to make any WiFi connections. When I have more time, I'll run a CAT5e to the TV and see how the SMART TV functions work.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Dimensions: (W) 42 1/2&#34; x (H) 27 1/2&#34; x (D) 10&#34; with the Stand<|SEP|><|SEP|>So would I recommend this Vizio E48-C2 LED HDTV?

16981,__label2__,4,N,Books,373778449,Burning Dawn (Angels of the Dark),"Fantasy-horror-rom-com with a lot of sex. A lot of fun, if you like that sort of thing.","I do not read Showalter religiously but have picked up enough of her books over the years to be pretty familiar with her style and her evolving trends. For a while there, people were concerned that she had toned down the sex to the point that she was losing a big part of what constituted her stories. Well, friends, I don't know if this is the first book where the trend reverses, but the sex is here.<|SEP|><|SEP|>I realize this is a bit like saying that you read Playboy for the articles - highly suspect - but I don't really care whether my romances have explicit sex in them or not. I generally skim or skip when the action gets too hot and heavy. (If I want erotica, I know where to find it.) I read Showalter because she manages somehow to go really super dark in her plots - hyper-violence! epic battles of good vs. evil! superbeings clashing over world-shattering stakes! - while still being really whimsical. Sometimes maybe a little on the verge of too much, maybe. The women in this book sounded to me like a Cosmo quorum. But it's still playful and breezy and good-spirited and leavens the darkness nicely. Fantasy-horror-rom-com.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Sometimes I have a problem with Showalter's world building. She's been at it so long and has built such an amazing canon that I'm constantly stumbling over plots and people I don't remember or just don't know, and I've run into a book or two where I felt sidelined by subplots or set-up for a future book. That wasn't an issue at all in Burning Dawn. There were references to the broader mythos and, yes, some groundwork, but it never distracted from the main story or left me confused.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Anyhoodle, if you pant over alpha men and flippant women with a heart of gold, if your stomach doesn't churn when people are disemboweled or beheaded in fiction (or if you can push past it), if you can handle a story that is simultaneously grim and bouncy, AND if you do not shy at some pretty explicit shenanigans between (and above and nowhere near) the sheets, this could be the book for you.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Fun times.

It looks like a nice steel band you'd expect on a dressier watch, but it's still lightweight and matches the case of the luminox. Each link of the band is held in place with a small screw, which I prefer to the springloaded pins (those always seem to launch away from me never to be seen again). Takes more tools to disassemble than pins I guess, but that wasn't an issue for me. Some reviewers complained about the screws working themselves loose...I haven't had this issue, but I would imagine that if you were worried about it, you could put a drop of loctite on the screws before reassembling the band back together"

After going years with cheap $20 pairs, I decided to look for a good upgrade and spend a bit extra. Well, this pair is near flawless. Great design - a lens that's large enough to not bother your peripheral vision, yet not too large to cover up your face. The sides are thick, so you get a bit of privacy from people viewing you from the side (i.e. when you take a nap on the bus.) Also, something to note is the way it sits on your face, obviously there are different shaped faces, but for me, the glasses sit far enough away so it doesn't press on your cheeks when you move your mouth or smile. The contact points are the sides of the ear and bridge of the nose - perfect. They also have a nice green tint to them, very subtle and providing a good amount of shading. They're also polarized, which adds to the cost, but increases the benefit. They also come with a large case, a little minus because it's so large, but they're specifically made for these so they won't get bent or crushed. Give these a try, I think you'll be quite happy you did."

I suspect Sylvania paid for the good reviews on this item.<|SEP|><|SEP|>EDIT: Customer service on the warranty was awful. AWFUL. You have to pay to shipping and handling to return it, and $7 for them to return it to you. And you get to speak with someone not in this country, who will make you repeat everything 150 times. I'm not sure I'll be returning this, but I can guarantee I will not buy another Sylvania ANYTHING, nor will I buy electronics again on this web site."

5847,__label1__,5,N,Books,1497364728,Unleash Your Potential: Beyond Just Motivation,A modern day philosopher!,"Indeed we can live to our highest potentials and make our short lives here on Earth as meaningful as possible. Thank you so much for writing eye-opening book. It's great to be given a pep talk on life and be reminded how much potential every person possesses. The fact that you are alive today makes you special having fought your way into human existence before conception. Even when we seem weaker than the rest, we can still rise up above the challenge and live our lives to the fullest by taking advantage of our situation in life. It doesn't matter whether we seem successful or not. Real success come from knowing our real value as a human being, that infinity we contain within our souls. I highly recommend this everybody right now. Our generation needs more writers like Olaoluwa to remind us that we are not our stuff. We are not our looks. We are who we are because of our souls and all the wonders we possess inside."

Sounds okay... possible quality issues,"I ordered the Luna Fauna Koi as a gift for my daughter, who's been taking lessons for more than a year now and is ready to step up from her 3/4 size Luna Safari Muse Mahogany travel guitar.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Out of the box, this guitar is quite lovely. The shining black lacquer is gorgeous, and the koi design truly stands out. There is additional abalone inlay around the sound hole, in the lunar phases on the neck, and the Luna name on the headstock. It's a folk-style guitar with a cutaway for higher notes, fairly small in body if you're comparing to the average dreadnaught. I did buy this for a 10 year old girl, and liked that Luna caters to those with smaller hands. According to the manufacturer, the top is select spruce, with mahogany sides and back. Fretboard and bridge are mahogany, with plastic nut and saddle. There is a preamp in the bottom, with battery installed, and a tuner in the side. This is helpful to me, as she's already lost her clip-on tuner.<|SEP|><|SEP|>We bought two guitars to compare, and one will go back. The Luna has a brighter sound, very lively. There's an unfortunate buzz when you try to play too loud, though, the strings just keep vibrating against the frets. Because of this, its volume range is less than the other guitar, a Takamine New Yorker body style. It does have a good feel, is comfortable to hold, and is lightweight for its size.<|SEP|><|SEP|>I should note that there is glue visible at some of the joints. Also be aware that this has only one strap button. You'll either need an acoustic strap, or install another button. Lastly, her teacher wants to adjust the truss rod, saying it's too bowed backwards. I have a few doubts about the quality of this guitar, will it hold up for years and years?<|SEP|><|SEP|>Overall, my initial impression is that this would be a fine guitar for a beginner or intermediate player, someone who doesn't have much of a musical ear yet. After two weeks or tryout, I had to edit my review down to 3 stars. It certainly has the looks to keep a young student interested, and the electric option may open another door for her down the road. But in terms of sound, it just can't compare to the other one. She really wants to keep the Luna, and we want the Takamine. Mommy may just have to put her foot down."

My wife purchased this for a Christmas gift, and I don't think I've been this excited over something so simple! The sheath is very well designed, with a ""rubber"" loop that can be attached/re-attached without taking your belt off. My preference is to put it on the Shoulder strap of my camelback (it's my new fishing buddy) for easy access. I've used every aspect of this multi tool, and it's worked great for repairing a crab pot, for taking fish hooks out of their toothy mouths, and even cutting wire. I've used the saw to cut smaller pieces of wood, have used the screw drivers, can opener, botle opener, knife and scissors without any challenges.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The flashlight (neatly and firmly attached to the sheath) is what you would expect from a one AAA light...not long life but if used as a true back up light or for limited bursts, it will last a few months. The firesteel is awesome, as long as you have time to play with it and figure out which technique works best for you. I've started a couple of fires with it now, and through trial and error, I've learned to scrape the black finish off the steel with the file, ""rough"" the steel surface up with the file edge (it really helps to create better spark), and to vary pressure, speed and angle of striker to maximize the sparks.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Once that was all figured out, it's become kind of a magic trick! I've been asked why not just use a lighter.

For people with big hands, you might want to attach a long strap to the camera to prevent dropping it by mistake. The menu system is pretty intuitive for settings. Nevertheless, this's a simple point-and-shoot, not much settings for me to play around. The screen is large and bright enough to see on a moderate sunny day. The small battery is the same as the one used in my Sony DSC-TX10. Be aware, the small battery won't hold too much charge (I learned it from using my Sony DSC-TX10), if you plan to use the camera for a long day, you should get a backup battery. The backup batteries are quite available in Amazon, with pretty good price.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The built in flash is strong enough to improve the lighting condition for objects in 6 feet range. Time from power-off to photo taking is less than 2 second, which is good for this small camera. The delay between shot is about 1 second if no flash light is used. When flash light is used, you need to wait a little bit longer for charging the flash light, this is pretty typical for camera in this price range.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The photo quality is just ok as the photo does not seem to be sharp. When shooting indoor where lighting is weak, you can see some grainy photos. The problem is less when shooting outdoor with good lighting.<|SEP|><|SEP|>In video taking mode, the menu already declares that zooming noise will be captured by the camera. I usually edit my videos, so I can silent the zooming noise from the video clips. Not a big issue to me. When you move your camera around in video mode, the camera adjusts the focus continuously. This is a camera, not a camcorder. So, don't move camera too fast, this gives camera time to adjust focus continuously.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The panorama mode is just for fun as the panorama photo quality is not very impressive. If you are seriously in creating panorama photos, I recommend to take still shots and create the final panorama photo with photo editing software.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The 8x lens is a big selling point for such a small point-and-shoot camera. But the image stabilization does not seem to be strong enough. So, you need a very steady hand to take advantage of the 8x lens, otherwise the photo will be blurry.<|SEP|><|SEP|>All in all, for price under $100, this would be a good buy. For price in the $130 range, there might be better options around."

11916,__label2__,5,Y,Tools,B0000226AU,Bucket Boss Brand 15051 Stacker System,Great system... but it's a bit too pricey now.,"I purchased 8 of these on 3/27/07 for about 3 bucks each with free shipping but I can't do it again for the current price of nearly 8 bucks. This is a great system and the system will either stack or it can be turned to nest on the one beneath it... which comes in handy if you have some trays that aren't full you can get a few more in the bucket. I read some reviews on these and don't quite get what the complaints are about. I get my 5 gallon buckets from emptying paint or spackle and there's no way I can get enough items into these trays to come anywhere near the weight when these buckets were full of what originally came in it. I have lots of screws & nails but I'd guess that only about 2/3 of the space in each tray is useable because of the way they're built so I'd say my heaviest bucket maxes out at about 30 pounds. I have about 20 of these trays and another 10 of another kind [[ASIN:B00023S8JU Custom LeatherCraft 1152 2?-Inch High, Full-Round Bucket Tray]] so I can have a dedicated bucket for nails, screws, plumbing parts, electrical parts and one for my drip-line watering system parts. If money is no object then I don't think you can do much better than this brand. That said, I'm buying LeatherCraft for about 4 bucks a tray, including shipping, because I'm cheap and it's a decent line though the handles are inferior to the ones on the Bucket Boss. This is, in my opinion, 5-stars all the way. If there's a downside to these it's that the dividers are much thicker than they really need to be and that diminishes the space you have in the tray."

It comes with a external power supply, but I have not used it yet as it powers up from the computer too with the included cord. I wish that it had two stacks of USB ports on the back and only one on the front as I fill up the back ones so quickly. The back side, in my opinion is the best place for the connections as most cords come up from the back anyway. So for me having more on the back is better. One on the front is all you really need as this would be for the connection to your PC. The cables coming around the front are messy looking. I do like the flip-up connections and wish that instead of having all the front connections they should just do more of the flip-up ones. I use them for my wireless transmitters such as for my wireless keyboard. This works great as it gets them up high for better range. I hate the lights! I leave my laptop on all the time, only using the sleep mode. My laptop/desk is located in my bedroom and those lights are so bright that it makes it impossible to sleep. (me...not the PC lol) I wish the unit had a switch to turn them off. I never can understand this ""blue"" light syndrome where manufacturers thing it is cool to have them. A simple light would be enough. Of course they go off when you shut down the computer. I tried just unplugging the main connection cord, but when I plug it back in the computer reloads all the drivers for everything connected. Strange that it does that. If it were not for the light-saber lights...I would rated it higher. All in all it is a nice unit."

11291,__label2__,5,N,Baby,B00PX8PIC4,"Graco Comfy Cruiser Click Connect Travel System, Stratus",Good and priced well,"Buying a travel system can be confusing. I went to Graco's website and still had a hard time telling why some cost more than others and I always find that it's something silly like adjustable height for the handle or something. I have this system [[ASIN:B00ASI748K Graco FastAction Fold Click Connect Travel System/Click Connect 30, Finley]] to compare to. So what do you get? A car seat. A base for the car seat. A stroller. The stroller is going to have the most feature difference between all the travel systems. This stroller has one hand closing system. There is a button in the middle of the handlebar of the stroller that you push. Turn the the handle (where the button is attached) and then let go. Then you can use the same hand to pull the tray towards you and it closes. And it stays upright. I can't open it one-handed though. The other Graco system I mentioned above had the handle in the base of the stroller that you pull and and it folds (almost lifting it). I like this one better. This system has locks for the front wheels if you don't want them to swivel (manual mentions grass). The storage area is bigger on this system. The base is different also. The old base I have has a bubble-level to get the seat in the car at the right angle. The problem with that is that there is so much leeway that it was useless. This system does away with the bubble and has a red line on the base that must be level with the ground. I would get a level and hold it against that red line. The car seat is good (and pretty much the same as other snugrides) and highly recommended from multiple sources. The click-connect is really nice and we can use the old bases we have."

This filter adapter tube has tiny pegs which tighten down on the outer part of the lens housing on the camera with simple allen wrenches that is included with the adapter. The lens adapter ring is metal & durable but it does not mount that tightly to the camera lens, it only connects in 2 points on the sides. I think that if it connected in 4 places that it wouldn't move up & down if you touch it. I was just not that comfortable cranking down on my new camera with some metal pegs to attach this thing.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The adapter ring screws off/on in the middle, so it can be used as a zoom lens tube or widescreen lens tube. I do love that someone made a 'fix' for Nikons inability to make a threaded end to the lens to affix a polarizing filter, but this gadget is limited to the makings of Nikon and the lens tube will be in the actual shot (photo) if you take a widescreen (zoomed out) shot with the telephoto adapter attachment on the lens.<|SEP|><|SEP|>When you have the widescreen (half adapter) attached to the lens, if you zoom out too much, the lens will hit the end of the filter & read an error. When this happens, all you have to do is turn the camera off & back on. You just have to get a feel of how to use this & the limitations. I actually lost the telephoto half of the ring & now have only the widescreen tube, but both tubes equally work with a filter & lens cap of any type (62mm) & I find that this is all I need anyway & that when I zoom into a shot, the lighting is at dusk or dawn or shadows (animals in the wilderness), so the camera actually takes a nice shot without the polarizer on it.<|SEP|><|SEP|>So, Yes I am happy to be able to use a polarizer on my new Nikon Coolpix SLR fixed lens, but the constant screwing & unscrewing from telephoto to widescreen was annoying, so I usually only shoot wide, or I take off the filter, leaving the tube on it, then the lens will zoom right through the tube with no problems, so you never have to take it off, just the filter you add.<|SEP|><|SEP|>This is more of a situation problem than any problem with this product, except for the way it moves up & down if you bump it with your hand, but it is not a deal breaker."

I was the next to empty the dw and when I opened it the plates looked like soft pretzels covered with salt. I took them out to wash off what I thought was soap by hand and it wasn't soap, it was some weird metal oxidation all over the non-stick side of every plate.

Unfortunately, Mother Nature conspired to not snow very much here in southern Nevada last winter and limited our time in the snow. This year; however, is a different story. A friend and I traveled to Bryce Canyon and Cedar Breaks National Monument during Veteran's Day weekend. We drove into a significant snow storm and after the weather cleared we hiked in fresh snow at Cedar Breaks. Long story short, I'm glad we packed the gaiters for the trip. Cedar Break's recieved over two feet snow during the storm and got the chance to use the gaiters over our hiking boots. Overall, these gaiters did the trick during the hiking at 10,000ft keeping us dry in deep snow - these gaiters ride high up to the knee which is perfect for tall folks, like me. The only miss with these gaiters are the strapping mechanism going under the boots, essentially, a string that needs to knotted. It was a little challenging squaring away the knot when the air temperature was around 0 dgs, but, we were able to get the gaiters secured and we move about the mountain with the greatest of easy and comfort. Good product for those who are outdoor types and need to keep dry in wet/snow conditions."

11035,__label2__,4,N,Health & Personal Care,B00STSUPCS,"Viva Labs TRIPLE STRENGTH Glucosamine, Chondroitin and MSM, GUARANTEED Joint Agony Relief, 240 Capsules",Glucosamine - Chondroitin - MSM,"I've been using glucosamine and chondroitin since around 1990 and then added MSM back around 15 years ago. I had the beginnings of arthritis and other bone problems and way back then, this product was pretty new to the public and I did a lot of research on it, so I'll tell you what my experience has been from using it all of these years. In general terms, what you're getting here is glucosamine to stimulate cartilage growth, and chondroitin to use for the growth itself. MSM is a chemical found in plants, animals, and humans and is an anti-inflammatory, or a weak version of NSAIDS like aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen. I had help from a physician who specialized in sports medicine back when I started using this. He promoted the use of a concentrated liquid version because it was a more effective delivery system to the body. But his theory made sense to me and it has proved out through the years of me taking this. I'll relate the gist of it. Every human body is different, but somewhere in your 20's the body starts growing cartilage less effectively and we can begin losing it faster than we regrow it. That's the reason to use this product. Having back the cartilage that you had when you were younger, is almost universally beneficial. But it doesn't fix injuries and so many other problems. Between my two knees, I've had surgery five times and the doc said that I had good cartilage, which allowed him to cut a lot away while he repaired various tears and other things. A lack of cartilage is just one other problem of many. Back to my sports doc, his theory on how to use this made sense to me, and this is what he said. Take a double dose of this for 30-40 days and you should get some fast regrowth and then be able to switch to the normal dose. About this same time, you should be feeling the benefits of having the new growth. If you feel no benefits, it's likely that a lack of of cartilage wasn't the problem that you suffered from in the first place, many don't. If you're happy with the results, you'll want to continue and grow as much back as possible, but at a point, you won't be anymore and using this product doesn't help, except to replace further loss. I've found that a half dose will maintain and regenerate my own losses, but this would be different for each individual. But you might want to experiment with this to reduce the daily cost of taking it. Taking other supplements like I do, would probably affect this also. As for this particular product? Only someone just starting out with this one, and taking it for 40-60 days could even have a valid comment on it's effectiveness, not me. This is why I'm telling you of my experience, because you'll have to try it for yourself to see. I'm not loyal to any brand and the additives like MSM are fine, but not a big deal for someone who already takes anti-inflammatory medication. I've also had my knees shot full of hyaluronic acid, which you'll find in some of these. It's a natural lubricant made from rooster combs and it's done little for me, and taking it orally is questionable. This is likely the 20th brand that I have used and it seems just like others that aren't from the big companies.The only reason for my 4 star rating, is because I like taking this supplement and have for many years, but I can't tell you how well this one works compared to another and I'm being honest about this, because I can't. Anybody telling you of the benefits from taking it just one week, well, I'd be skeptical of. That wasn't how it worked for me or others that I've talked with or my doc's understanding of using it. Most of all, I hope that I've helped you to understand how and why this product can potentially help you. Try it to find out for yourself, and then you should decide whether or not it helps you, and even if it doesn't seem to help much today, whether or not you like the idea of it preventing future pain from the lack of cartilage.

They are both big and sturdy. I've filled them to the limits of their width without the folder bowing at the bottom. They come with nifty reinforcement strips that you place in the bottom and these seem able to hold any weight you can fit into the folder, including instruction books and manuals (I've tested it). Another reviewer complained that papers get bent or bowed by the reinforcement strips but I haven't had that happen yet to me. The strip is as wide as the folder's base so I can't imagine it would happen without over-stuffing the folder. The price is high (almost $40) for 25 folders and I don't know that I would have spent that much on these sight unseen. Havin been able to see them for myself I can see how useful they can be but I'm still not certain I'd pay that much. On the other hand, I can't imagine needing more than 25 of these unless you use them in a business setting so perhaps it's not such a terribly steep investment looked at that way. I give them a 5 based on usefulness and sturdiness. I would probably give them a 4.5 if permitted to account for the steep price."

12361,__label2__,5,N,Video Games,B004TMGZ9K,Disgaea 4: A Promise Unforgotten - Playstation 3,Wonderful Game to Add To This Series,"I'll say it right now. Gameplay wise, Disgaea 4 is the best of the best in the series and for good reasons. The gameplay picks up after Disgaea 3 and improving it meaning weapon change is still possible and instead of giving so many characters to make and giving them too many weapons they can master, most character are limited to two to three weapons they can master. They made how many more characters bearable. You don't have to work to get a bigger classroom with mana. Instead you unlock a panel on the character map for every chapter you complete, so by the end of the game, you'll have plenty of panels. If you run out out room, the characters are placed in another room which is very beneficial for the player.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Weapon change works much better in this game compared to the third so the monsters turn into weapons that benefits them. Seriously, who thought it would be a good idea for a magic based unit like an Alraune to be a spear in Disgaea 3. Here the Alaraune turns into a staff that makes him/her more beneficial in battle when given to a mage.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Story wise, Disgaea 4 finally matches the first Disgaea in terms of a lovable cast and a great story. The story heavily revolves around politics, so unless you understand how politics work it will be hard to draw parallel to the real world references the game is referencing. Valvatorez is a great protagonist. Mature space cadet with a great moral standard and wonderful stats that is obsessed with sardines. His character works because he manages to be funny upon introduction. I won't spoil the story because it's easy to put together once you get into it...if you're not too busy with the item world. Which is another thing. The character world isn't available until you reincarnate one character at LV 100 (or reincarnation adds up to LV 100) meaning you won't get the character world until post game unlike Disgaea 3 which is my only negative of this game when reincarnation is essential for the post game.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Overall, it's a great game that you should pick up if you're into games like this....<|SEP|><|SEP|>Also Axel is back. :D"

I had a 12 year old 2-line VTech system that had served us well but one hand set was hard for me to hear on and the battery's wouldn't hold like they did when new.

Granted, I am moderately color blind, but you can't tell you teammates from your foes until the &#34;gamertag&#34; floats above their body.

It took hours to find the right firmware to update the boxee and get it connected to the LAN. The video quality is really good. The remote control is a little awkward but works well. The box is small. People talk about it not fitting on a shelf. A DVD case is taller than the box. The HDMI cable it comes with is short. It should be close to your receiver.

The rest is a rigid piece of plastic - for me it's the first thing to replace (with a good fall away or whisker biscuit, your choice). The 3 pin sight is usable - but this bow does not come with a peep. And a heads up, many of the draw length or weight adjustments will require a bow press and a qualified individual, most in fact. Finally, the quiver is a bit close to the riser, too close to use comfortably with my rest installed - you may wish to get a better one of these. Considering that I can have this set up hunting ready (for me anyway) for a total cost of under 200, I'd say it's worth it, though."

The book is written in a question and answer format, the authors asking the questions they believe the reader would ask and then answering them. It actually makes for an easy read and makes it easy to explain some of their more complex thoughts. Overall there is nothing earth shattering in this book, it all comes down to basic common business sense, the authors just organize it in very thoughtful way, and they support all of their claims with references a large pool of research they are pulling from. They offer ideas and strategies to improve your score in all three of the categories.<|SEP|><|SEP|>So I don’t think this book offers any earth shattering ideas, it is full of a lot of good ones.

Since my sink is pretty big, this has been working perfectly during the rare times when I want to use a rinse basket to drain the dishes before I dry them. It has also been working very well as a counter-top dish drying rack as long as I put a drying mat underneath (since it does not come with a drain board). I never liked dish drainers so I use a drying mat similar to [[ASIN:B004M0P34M The OriginalTM Dish Drying Mat XL Microfiber Absorbent Machine Washable Fast Drying 18""X24"" Multipurpose Extra Large]]. However, sometimes I wash so many dishes that they don't fit on the mat. With this rack, I can get 8 large fiesta dinner dishes and a couple of small bowls upright so that I don't have to wash the dishes in shifts. I also sometimes wash the dishes and put them in the rinse basket and let them drain before putting the entire contraption with dishes on the drying mat.<|SEP|><|SEP|>This rinse basket arrived in a box with no instructions to say what material it was made of, the measurements of the basket, or where to return for a replacement should the rack fail. The Amazon page says it's a stainless finish and has a 1-year warranty. The measurements on the Amazon page say it fits a bowl size that is 14 x 16 with center drain. I would say that is correct since the rack measures 15 inches wide from front to back (long wise), 12 inches wide from side to side (width wise) at the widest point, and 6-1/2 inches high if I count the feet. The feet are rubberized so that it does not slip around in the sink.<|SEP|><|SEP|>My sink is 8 inches deep, 21-1/2 inches wide from left to right, and 17 inches wide from front to back (18-1/2 wide if I count the notch on the left). I use this on the right side of my (single-bowl) sink and wash on the left side. I then store this in the top rack of my dishwasher within easy reach for when I want to use it again. I could leave it in the sink but I do not always wash so many dishes at once. However, if I had side-by-side sinks, I would leave this in the sink.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The unit feels very sturdy, is really nice looking, and what I consider a 5-star product. The only reason I rated this 4 stars is because of the following:<|SEP|><|SEP|>- Utensils fall through the rack as there is no utensil basket. I could use my dishwasher utensil basket but that would take up valuable space in this rack.<|SEP|><|SEP|>- I consider the current price of $63.75 a bit steep for a rinse basket. However, if this lasts for life then it's cheap. Only time will tell if this lasts and does not rust; I will update my review if I encounter any problems.<|SEP|><|SEP|>- The lack of an information sheet with the product description and warranty information is mildly disappointing.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Other than this, I feel this basket is high quality and perfect as a rinse basket.

I searched everywhere for a grey crib with a modern ascetic. I finally came across this Hudson crib and knew it was the one. My son's name happens to be Hudson making it that much more fitting. The wood is sturdy and of very good quality. The grey color is beautiful, although a little lighter than the Oeuf. The open slats on all four sides make it airy and comfortable for baby. It took us about an hour to put together and we had no problems. There are 4 different mattress height options. The crib sits low to the ground which makes it easier to get baby in and out without breaking your back. It comes with the toddler rail which is an added bonus. You have to buy it extra with the Oeuf at $200+. I am so happy that I found this crib. I would recommend it to any family.<|SEP|><|SEP|>UPDATE: At 18 months my son figured out how to crawl out of the crib. I was so glad we already had the toddler rail as we had to do a quick change late one night to prevent my little guy from breaking his neck. It was beyond easy to unscrew the front panel of the crib and attach the toddler rail. It took us all of 10 minutes. It's a huge transition from the crib to toddler bed (for both baby and parents) but it was made so much easier because we could continue to use the crib he'd been sleeping in from the beginning. I am still so glad that I chose the Hudson crib over the Oeuf. It has held up very well and is in great condition after almost two years. I expect that we will continue to use it for at least another year or so."

My son is around 3 and I have always hesitated putting headphones on her when she is on her Fire HD Kids Tablet. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00LOR524M While this is the feature I wanted, if you are in a very loud area or on a plane that is fairly loud (small ones where you are close to engines), then they don't work the best. He sometimes had a hard time hearing the sound even with these maxed out. These changed my thinking. I also chose these because they have the reduced volume feature to protect his hearing. I tried these on and had my volume turned all the way up and they were about 75% of the normal max volume. They are also fairly sturdy, I wouldn't be afraid of them breaking unless you actually tried to break them.

First of all, I put filtered water into the two MUI Color 600ML diffusers I ordered. The instructions say to use tap water, but I don't even drink straight tap water, and I don't like the thought of diffusing chlorine, fluoride, etc. They shut off after about 5 minutes. So, I had to use tap water. I also don't like that the water to EO ratio is so high. By that I mean, the instructions call for 2 drops of oil in a full tank of water. I can hardly smell the oils I'm trying to permeate the house with for both the beautiful aromas as well as the healing powers. On the plus side, they run a long time, and they're sort of interesting looking. I wanted to put them on 24 hour timers, like 30 minutes on, 30 minutes off, but they don't work on timers because once they shut off, they turn back on only when the button is pushed. I contacted the seller about returning them, but since they actually run, I'd have to pay shipping, so I kept them. They're more of a humidifier than an oil diffuser, so I'll probably use them in winter."

The metal ring used for the foot rest is very nice and surprisingly slick, though I may just be too used to seeing my nasty corroded one at work.<|SEP|><|SEP|>A weak point might be the mesh back, which I could see tearing or fraying at some point because it is just a sheet of fabric. The cushion also might wear quickly. I will update my review if I have any issues over time.<|SEP|><|SEP|>COMFORT<|SEP|><|SEP|>If you've never sat in an extended height chair, it is important to know that the foot rest (metal ring) is adjustable, allowing you to set it to a height that is comfortable and does not cut off leg circulation. This chair's ring is a standard diameter, which means that the heels rest a bit behind the knees. I don't know why this is the standard, but a wider ring might be more comfortable. The metal is nicely rounded, but I find that setting my bare feet on it is not comfortable for long stretches. This is not an issue for using it at work.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The chair itself is firm, but in a good way, with a proper amount of cushion. The back is nice and the mesh keeps my back cooler in the Summer. It is not the fancy mesh material that is more springy and supportive, but it works well.<|SEP|><|SEP|>SUMMARY<|SEP|><|SEP|>The Vue is a good standard extended-height office chair. The build quality is solid, it is simple to use, and generallycomfortable. It is not likely to make anyone jealous, but it also won't make you jealous of them."

20757,__label2__,3,N,Home Entertainment,B004SKBILS,Philips PB9011/37 9-Inch 1080p Portable DVD Player,"OK Blu-Ray/DVD players for the back seat, but a bit expensive","The Philips PB9011 portable Blu-Ray DVD Player is a pretty good option for the back seat of a car, but it doesn't offer much more than less expensive players unless you are committed to Blu-Ray discs. Pros: - They generally do what they are supposed. They provide an ok movie watching experience for the back seat. - 9"" screens are on the bigger side for portable players intended for the car. - The carrying case fits everything perfectly and easily. No jamming stuff into place or having to figure out what should go where. It really is well done. With kids, it is important that things can easily be put away properly. - As the name says, it plays Blu-Ray discs. In reality, the quality on this player doesn't allow Blu-Rays do much more than a DVD, but if you already have a Blu-Ray disc, you can still play it in the car with the PB9011. In the past, we had to limit ourselves to DVD's just in case we wanted to watch the movie in the car at some point. Nice! Cons: - You can only watch one movie at a time. The second screen is only a slave to the primary. The other (much less expensive) portable DVD players that we have can work as a pair or independently. - The volume control is a physical dial on the side of the player, so it can't be controlled by remote and it requires a little more fidgeting than a digital volume control. - The sound is ok but not great. It sounds much more like mono than stereo and doesn't get very loud without deteriorating. - The screen washes out in sunlight. In the back seat of a car, it is tough to control going into and out of sunlight. These screens don't do well with that. - The cables are quite a mess in the back of the car, but that is hard to avoid with a pair of portable screens. - The remote control feels flimsy. We'll see how it holds up. - The screens don't tilt on their backings like our other players do. If the angle is off for the person watching the movie, you have to play with how it is strapped to the headrest insteadof just tilting it up or down."

One of the biggest challenges has been doing large roasts or turkeys in the winter, because so much heat is lost when you stop for a temperature check, as opposed to using a purpose-built smoker.

From my living room window, I can keep an eye on smoke output, meat temperature, and ambient temperature. The Bluetooth range isn't stellar, but I found that keeping the app running on an iPad Mini on a kickstand connected to some external speakers for the temperature alarm is the ultimate in lazy cooking.

If you have a smaller room, this sound bar will fill your room nicely. It doesn't really replicate surround sound very well, but good enough to get a better movie experience.

It works well with this: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008G8G8Y?tag=i60-20 I had originally been turned on to these pens when I had come across an article showing that these Sakura pens had the best chemical, heat, and moisture resistance. Found here: [...] Ink stability is tantamount in a notebook for company or personal use. I can write with confidence knowing that my writing won't smear or fade and possibly lead me in a touchy legal situation. I also really like the fact that the caps STAY on the opposite ends when writing, unlike some pens which don't positively lock on and fall off, eventually being lost. My only gripe is that I'm often afraid of bending the tips of the smaller diameter pens. I use these pens at work in labs to document my findings and observations, as well as to draw any intellectual property that may be used in legal disputes. REMEMBER, your word is only as good as your documentation, engineers! Side note: A lot of the people who use the pens are incorrectly describing the sizes. The pen designation is a #005 and not it's diameter, not .005in, or 0.005mm. That #005 is 0.20mm in diameter, the &#34;&#34;#&#34;&#34; does not directly correlate to the pen diameter."

The game is designed completely around the need for the real-money auction house to compete and do well in the end-game. The difficulty curve in the final stages of the game is so absurd and the loot system is so obscenely weighted against you in terms of probabilities to actually receive an upgrade, that you have no choice but to farm for hours on end to afford to purchase upgrades from the auction house. This game could have been named: ""The World of Auctions"" and it would have at least not been as big a let down as slapping the Diablo franchise on the front of the box.<|SEP|><|SEP|>One month into the game, Blizzard releases the real money auction house. Now the auction house that uses the in-game currency (Gold) is a barren wasteland of good loot. It's meh-mediocre at best. Anything very good to great gets slapped on the Real-money auction house for 25 bucks or more, sometimes 250 bucks. It's ridiculous. But here's where Blizzard's greed starts to shine through. They get $1 for every successful Real-money auction. So there's no incentive for them to fix their broken game experience. They'll just sit back and watch desperate people trying to squeeze an ounce of fun out of their game by spending their real income on virtual garbage. Did a champion pack with aggravating affixes just demolish you repeatedly? Why not spend 5 bucks on this amulet to improve your chances?<|SEP|><|SEP|>Then there's the fact that the real-money auction earnings either dump directly into a blizzard balance that you have to spend in their digital store, or you can transfer it through paypal to your account. Paypal takes their cut, and I wouldn't be surprised if Blizzard owns some part ofPaypal through subsidiaries.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Soon, even the in-game currency will be available for purchase through their real-money auction house. They couldn't figure out how to make a game that the Chinese wouldn't farm and sell virtual goods in, so they just embraced it, and now they're going to get their cut at least.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Just do yourself a favor, go play something else. This game is nothing but a money grab in a somewhat pretty looking but poorly developed gaming experience."

The baKblade is definitely set apart from the other back shavers for multiple reason. First, the baKblade has a larger blade that covers so much ground when shaving you are literally done in less than a minute. The shave actually feels great and because of the way the shaving blades are arranged it's impossible to cut your back when using the shaver. Also, there is no need for shaving cream when dry shaving as you can see from the video the shaver doesn't take much effort to actually get the job done either. I have recommended this shaver to many friends and family and no one has every had a negative thing to say about it. Also, the handle is very lightweight and has an ergonomic curve to it that allows the user to reach the ""hard to reach"" areas. Another feature of this shaver that is a huge benefit is the fact that it actually tackles longer hairs too so if you are shaving your back for the first time there's no need to use a hair trimmer or electric trimmer to trim away first. The blade surprisingly works under any circumstance. Take a look at my video and please vote ""yes"" if you feel this video was helpful to you."

They are very durable and the stand that is included on the receiver is very useful. As far as setting it up with consoles, I didn't have any problems and only connected the optical cable and USB for power so that was pretty easy. I did use them connected to my iPhone which was awesome because if I wasn't using the mic I would just listen to my music while I was playing and you can still hear the game too.

I created a custom control unit with arduinos and home automation software, which I use to manage the pump. Total cost was about $300 to set up.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The Bad:<|SEP|><|SEP|>One of the features this pump has is the SVRS protection, which is there to prevent people from getting stuck on or in the drain by the suction. It's a good safety feature, however most pool cleaners will trigger this and shut the pump off. We are unable to reliably use our pool cleaner because of this. The only time it is disabled is during priming, and there is no way to adjust the sensitivity, just the timeout between the next start. If it happens too many times it just plain disables the pump until manually reset. Additionally it has started triggering all of the time now, on non-pool cleaner inputs.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The fan is not fully enclosed, there have been a few lizards who have snuck in there, and not had a good time. Now the fan rattles from being knocked around/nicked.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The on pump menu control is a huge pain to navigate. There are two buttons, select, and enter. You have to use select in the main menus, and enter in the sub menus. If you screw up pressing the wrong one it tells you INVALID KEY, and pauses all input for a few seconds, as you wonder why they didn't just make one button. One is in the middle of the navigation, so you would think you would use that most of the time, no, its the one to the upper left that you use more frequently.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Not specifically the pumps fault (doesn't impact the rating), but mine didn't come with all the required parts.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Summary:<|SEP|><|SEP|>If I had it to buy over again, I would probably look at the non-SVRS version of this pump, or look into getting a Hayward unit.

But personally, I love it. it came out right as the action comedy genre was starting to become popular, and this is one of the finer efforts. Basically, take Mel Gibson's Lethal weapon, replace Danny Glover with Goldie Hawn, add A LOT more comedy and reduce the action sequences (though there are still some of those), and you have Bird on a Wire. Not to say that there isn't action in the movie, because there is. But this action-comedy definitely emphasizes the latter and not the former. It's a really good one."

I anticipated them only being good enough to use for public address, but I have recently even been using them for vocals. They aren't as good as a quality wired mic, but they hold their own. They are very cardioid, so you have to stay right on them to be heard. This is not so good if you want to pick up a group of people on one mic, but it really helps eliminate feedback and background noise.

18179,__label2__,4,Y,Kitchen,B00HYVQXFE,"Koyal Wholesale 404341 6-Pack Cylinder Glass Vases, 4 by 24-Inch",Good deal but not perfect pieces,Seller was very fast at shipping item (Amazon prime purchase). All pieces were intact & very well packaged. 2 of the 6 vases have some imperfections & the thickness of the vases is not consistent but they are all still very thick ( some more than others). This is only noticeable if you are looking into the vase from up top. I was pleasantly surprised by the thick walls as I was afraid they would be thin walled & not safe to use with glass rocks. The two &#34;imperfect&#34; pieces will still be used. One has a brown pebble in the glass near the top that may cause a problem with the glass cracking & the other vase has an area where swirls are visible & can be felt in the glass. I would recommend purchasing extra to account for imperfections/breakage to make sure you have enough usable vases. These vases were a great budget friendly solution to center pieces without spending $30 a vase at craft stores.

They're not all shaped the same, they don't all go to the bathroom the same. It takes patience to find the right diaper for your baby. Just because my friend prefers swaddlers doesn't mean I do too. The Pampers Baby Dry is a good fit for my child. She's pretty small and long. I've noticed my friends with fuller, thicker babies don't have as much good luck. But for me, this is a great, thin, super-absorbant diaper that works well. The price is a great value as well.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Be aware though, no diaper will elimnate diaper rash! Despite how absorbant your diaper choice is, your baby will still at some point have diaper rash. My best luck has been butt paste diaper cream ([[ASIN:B00BMIVQ3E All Natural Boudreaux's Butt Paste + FREE Baby Ganics Thick N' Kleen (Fragrance Free) Baby Wipes]]) because it seals up the sensitive skin and I can still re-diaper my girl right away without a lot of fuss. With diaper rash and rash cream, make sure the diaper doesn't rub anywhere to hard and that they've got some flexibility. The Baby Dry leaves plenty of room for my baby."

Those kill your back after a while. I can hold my 20 pound baby for quite a while with no back pain.<|SEP|><|SEP|>2. It's really easy to adjust. My husband and I both use this product quite often. My husband is about 8 in. taller than me, so this is a must for us. Not only is it easy to adjust, it's pretty quick too.<|SEP|><|SEP|>3. There are several carrying positions. There are 4 to be exact. Facing you narrow seat, facing you wide seat, facing out, and backpack. The facing you narrow seat is great when the baby is too small to wrap their legs around you. This is a problem with most ergonomic baby carriers. Then when the baby is big enough, you can use the facing you wide seat, which is the safest position for babies in carriers-especially for longer periods of time. Facing out is great when baby can hold their head up and want to explore. I haven't used the backpack carry yet, but I imagine that will be very helpful as my baby grows.<|SEP|><|SEP|>There's only one drawback in this carrier. It's hard to change from the wide seat to the narrow seat. It's very hard to get the toggles and buttons through the holes. This may just be to keep the carrier more secure though, so it may be a good thing.<|SEP|><|SEP|>It's a great carrier. I'd recommend it to anyone."

After traveling extensively for a full year, I have yet to find a seat that it fits under easily, without having to be squished and shoved mightily (an entertaining spectacle for one's seatmates). Unfortunately this rough handling this leads to undue wear and tear on the bag, making it look beat-up well before a bag of its quality should with normal use. Additionally, when full the bag is a bit unwieldy and heavy for lifting into the overhead bin on the occasions where it doesn't fit under the seat.

She felt that her years as a teacher prepared her for this.<|SEP|><|SEP|>For most of us, loose ends are frightening reminders of our own powerlessness. To name, to label, to classify gives us the illusion of control, even if the closure reached is a false one.<|SEP|><|SEP|>In all events, it is important to leave the directee free to accept or reject our insights. Whether we are right, wrong or premature, it is reassuring to remember that we cannot do too much harm since people rarely hear what they are not ready to hear. At the very least, we have possibly planted a seed. As director-midwives, then, we must be willing to wait for the seed to sprout -- if it is supposed to sprout -- and grow to maturity, perhaps long after our relationship with the directee has ceased.<|SEP|><|SEP|>If you feel bored by a conversation, the person might be depressed.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Like children, directees are on loan.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Books should be prescribed cautiously because directee might feel guilty if not appropriate.<|SEP|><|SEP|>To clarify: `Tell me more.' `I don't quite understand.'<|SEP|><|SEP|>The spiritual director as teacher does not make the connections, although she may make observations, give hints (but without being manipulative), and ask the right questions. Her supportive presence sets the directee free to make the connections; and inner and outer work turn out to be all of a piece.<|SEP|>We may spare the very fragile, those who have already more reality than they can bear and are not yet ready to hear the truth. It is sometimes hard to sit with an insight, yet we may say nothing, or we may measure out manageable bits of truth. But with the strong and spirituallymature we need not be so cautious.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Can tell one's own story if invited or intuit.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The purpose of education is to show a person how to define himself authentically and spontaneously in relation to his world -- not to impose a prefabricated definition of the world, still less an arbitrary definition of the individual himself (Thomas Merton, Love and Living, p. 3)"

I just love these! I've used them quite a bit since receiving them and think they are fabulous. I don't understand why anyone would say they are flimsy...this makes no sense. These are small measuring spoons...how thick and heavy can they be...my goodness...they are as thick and sturdy as they can be for their size and at an excellent price. You can find heavier measuring spoons by All Clad for $23+-, although I am sure some people will find something to complain about them as well. I don't know what some people expect. Prior to purchasing them I read many of the reviews and did see that people had a problem with the magnet coming out. I personally would not put these in the dishwasher. The high temp of the dishwasher water may be able to melt the glue that holds the magnets so why bother putting them in the dishwasher. I don't have a problem washing things by hand...do it all the time. I would not let them soak in hot hot water for the same reason. When I'm done using them I'm just soaping them up in medium hot water rinsing and drying. Pretty easy! It is just as fast as putting them in the dishwasher and then getting them out and putting them away. Often with little spoons like this you end up having to hand dry them anyway because all of the water did not get out of the spoon cavity. If the magnets do fall out we will just use a good glue and put them back in. It is not going to be deal breaker for me.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Also, I read in reviews that people complained about the ink/paint marking the sizes coming off. Again, the strength of dishwasher detergent is certainly strong enough to break down the size markings..so again, washing by hand avoids this problem.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Some complained that they would not sit flat on the countertop. I'm looking at my set right now as I type this and my spoons are sitting on the counter and are perfectly balanced. I can see no reason for them to tip over otherthan if you bump them or have ghosts. People just want to complain...period!<|SEP|><|SEP|>These are very very nice and I do like how they connect via the magnet. I am going to purchase another set for myself and will no doubt buy them for gifts. I will recommend to all that they be washed by hand...what is the big deal..."

11313,__label2__,5,N,Video DVD,B004VNJ0T4,The Day Lincoln Was Shot (Tvm),A History of the Assassination,"The Day Lincoln Was Shot, 1998 film<|SEP|><|SEP|>Abraham Lincoln and his wife went to a play on Good Friday April 13, 1865. So did John Wilkes Booth. This is a history of that event. At the Surratt Boardinghouse men talk about politics. Booth conspires with his men about capturing Lincoln to exchange for Confederate prisoners. Will it work? Booth the actor has lady admirers, he dances in a ballroom. Lincoln is told he needs more security. Secretary of War Stanton arrives with news of the capture of Richmond. Lincoln wants to visit Richmond. He visits Secretary of State Seward who was injured in a carriage accident. Fireworks celebrate the victory. Lincoln asks the band to play “Dixie”, he plans to welcome the rebel states back. Mary Lincoln shows jealousy and spite. Abraham has a dream about his death. [Do people still believe in dreams?]<|SEP|><|SEP|>Lincoln signs pardons for condemned Union soldiers. Lincoln’s son tells about his military experiences. Booth learns about the President’s planned visit to the theater that night and makes plans. Lincoln’s Cabinet recommends harsh punishment for the Rebel leaders, but Lincoln does not want more “bloody work”. They plan to reestablish the courts and the mail system. [Note the dirt roads.] Mrs. Surratt is asked to deliver a package. [This makes part of the conspiracy.] Booth breaks up with Lucy. The conspirators plan to strike at the same time. Lincoln and the Rathbones arrive late. The play goes on. Booth arrives at the theater, a man holds his horse. The other conspirators begin their crimes. There is confusion in the theater! Doctors treat Lincoln.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Soldiers arrive. Lincoln is moved to the nearest house across the street. Booth’s leg was injured during his dramatic leap to the stage. Stanton order protection for the Cabinet, the city locked down, and everyone in the theater arrested. The doctors say Lincoln is doomed, he can not survive. Dr. Mudd says Booth’s fibula is broken, he must rest. Itrains in Washington. Lincoln dies at 7:22 AM. “Now he belongs to the ages.” Suspects are rounded up. Twelve days later the Garrett farm is surrounded. One soldier shoots Booth inside a burning barn (Booth shaved off his mustache as a disguise). “Useless” is his last word. The ending credits list what happened afterwards. Mary Surratt was hanged even though there was no conclusive proof of her guilt. [Her son escaped to Europe.] Dr. Mudd got four years as an accessory after the fact. Andrew Johnson became the 17th President, Reconstruction had a vindictive policy towards the South.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The northern dominated Congress passed high tariffs on imports which increased industrialization in America. New laws liberalized corporations, they grew in power to form a new aristocracy. [Previously the privilege of incorporation and limited liability were only given to businesses that served the public interest, such as water companies, canals, and railroads.] This is a good history lesson but details had to be eliminated to make this movie fit into its allotted time period. You should read the book for the details that were omitted in this movie. What should be the Reconstruction policy? Harsh punishment for rebellion or a welcome for misguided politics? Machiavelli wrote the duty of a leader was not to chose between the good and the bad but between the bad and the worse; this is one example. You can’t please all of the people all of the time. Abolishing slavery punished the big landowners, those who financed the Confederacy would see their bonds worthless. “A rich man’s war but a poor man’s fight” was one description."

I thought I would give the lower price range tablets a try due to financial concerns. I have to say initially I was very much hoping that I would just go straight over to this coby and not have a issue. Wrong..... For the first week it kept turning on and off intermittently (and at the worst times), then it would freeze and need to be restarted. I hated the thing and was ready to return it. However, after the initial 30 or so reboots i think that it finally had the libraries where it wanted them to be. I really feel like i got a good deal for the money. I dont use face book so i cant say how that works, but I do stream netflix, I do play a ton of apps ( forget using the amazon appstore its not worth it and i used it religously before the change over), and i listen to tons of music. It does all of these things great. I have found new appstores GOOD E Reader appstore is a good one to start with. It does all of these things just fine. It has a really good sound from the one external speaker it has.

I've owned it for a year. It is a fairly large watch with a resin band so it may feel a little odd if you have slender wrists, but it is very lightweight. The current watch face does have a few small scratches over the course of my time using it but they're not particularly bad and everything else has held up well. It's done fine given that this is essentially my beater watch.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The World Time features are nice and easy to use. You can select 5 time zones as your most frequent time zones for the primary timekeeping mode and then easily change the main time zone out as needed. It's particularly nice because you can easily turn DST on or off for any one time zone. It's also been holding time quite well.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The 5 alarms are useful - They can be set to be single use or recurring which makes them nice for simple reminders or as a backup wake-up alarm (although it's a little quiet if you're a heavy sleeper). The digital timer is a very useful feature and the stopwatch works as advertised.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The analog face is a little pointless in that it's extremely difficult to read compared to a true analog watch. The center dot is extremely large compared to the size of the face's hand segments. It's more of a novelty, but it does allow you to see the time in your primary time zone in all modes (including the stopwatch or timer mode) so it's useful in that respect. The Light is an orange/amber colored LED that illuminates the time from the side of the face rather than evenly throughout the entire face of the watch. It works fine, regardless.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Need a cheap watch with plenty of features? It's not terribly slim, but it's got that great intersection of price and plenty of features that it's hard not to recommend."

Level 1 to 100 are all the same strong shocks,"This is false advertising. First when I tested the levels 3 to 15 it produced no shock. I didn't think that this was a big deal because my dog is only 25 lbs. When I had to use it on my dog it yelped and started shaking with level 1. I then hooked up a multi-meter and check the amps and voltage output and found out that levels 1-100 all produced the same level of very strong shock. So I went online ang googling and see if I'm doing something wrong and the search point me straight to some Youtube videos. I have found out the 100 levels advertised are not really 100 levels but 100 different frequencies so that the remote won't interfere with other radio frequencies so basically this collar has only 1 level of very strong shock. Upon further reading the other reviews, I see 1 buyer also had the same complaint that the collar has only 1 level of strong shock. To me this is a very dangerous collar that could hurt your dog. Please buy at your own risk. I will be returning this collar and get the Petsafe brand at my local pet store."

The sizes I mostly fasten range from 13 to 17 millimeters.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The material:<|SEP|>This adapter is made of an impact resistant steel, coated with a black smooth non-reflective material.

It fits perfectly to my impact driver and is really easy to attach to many different sockets. The adapter has a ball-and-spring locking mechanism which found itself really sturdy for many applications. The way I work, I have to keep on switching between sockets all day long and after 6 months of continuous use the mechanism still works as new.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Overall:<|SEP|>It's worth a 5 star overall rating. It's tough, it's corrosion resistant, it's locking mechanism works fine, it's impact resistant and it's cheap for the quality you get. I totally recommend it."

These don't catch all the hair, but they do reduce the volume of hair that gets down the drain. When the drain slows from accumulated hair, I pour white vinegar and baking soda down the drain, wait 15 minutes, run hot water down the drain, and then I use a plunger on top of the drain to create a vacuum and push any leftover clog around the pipe bend, so there's no more obstruction and the tub drains fast.. Between these drain protectors and that cleaning method, I don't have to clean the drain often and I don't have to use toxic products. And at the cheap price for these (and they're biodegradable), I can replace them when they get more built-up soap scum than I like. You can also clean them in the dishwasher, or soak them in water and a little bleach if you like."

They come hidden inside purple plastic eggs that pull apart at the side into two pieces. This series include some very fresh new and innovative designs. They pretty much all have to do with prehistoric themes. There are ancient eggs-hibits which include dino poop, boggy bonfire, and scum scorcher (also a fire character). There are scrambled animals including the very cool battered bat, puking primate, rotten tooth tiger, and soft boiled sloth to name a few. One of my favorite kinds of trashies in this series are the puke eggs. These are a clear chartreuse egg shaped outer shell with a tiny solid trashy trapped inside. These characters include a poached spider, baked bug, and waste wasp and many more. There is hard boiled trash which feature a speckled, granite like finish. There is eggs-cavated trash which look like fossilized critters stuck in a broken open rock. Some of the characters include sewer slither (a snake), soiled shrimp, oozy octopus, and runny roach. There are eggstinct trash which feature dinosaur characters. There are four limited edition trashies: slime skull, manky maggot, litter lizard, and scrambled rat. These new trash pack additions are very clever and detailed and were a serious hit with my son. Any trash pack collector will crack their shell over these!!"

15143,__label2__,4,N,Books,2954168129,Wolfsangel (The Bone Angel Series) (Volume 2),A Moving Story,"Céleste is a young French woman living in a small village in France during World War II. German soldiers are living in the village and most of the French residents are not happy with the occupation. Céleste’s brother is a member of the French resistance. Céleste wants to join the cause, however, her brother won’t let her in an effort to keep her safe. However, when her brother is arrested, she feels that she has to join the resistance to help him escape.<|SEP|><|SEP|>You would think this is enough stress for one character to endure. You’d be wrong. Not only is Céleste a member of the resistance, she’s also a young woman in love. With a German officer. Yep, you read that right. While she’s fighting against the Germans, she is also in a secret relationship with one. That’s not all for the twists and turns, but I don’t want to ruin the novel.<|SEP|><|SEP|>I have to admit that I wasn’t too familiar with this part of the war before reading this. I had heard that the German occupation of France was peaceful for the most part. This novel shows how devastating the occupation was to the individuals and families who had to endure it. I found myself cheering on Céleste and her compatriots.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The plot kept me engaged and I found myself rushing through to the end to find out what would happen. Every time I thought poor Céleste wouldn’t be able to handle any more, there was yet another hurdle for her to overcome. She didn’t always make the right choice, but she was brave throughout. I admired her determination, overlooked her impetuosity (she’s only 19 at the start of the story), and wanted her to succeed even though the odds were against her. You’ll have to read for yourself to find out if she did. This story shows the true brutality of war, even on the “peaceful” fronts, and it highlights how brave people can be during such a horrific time in history."

That's all it does. But, it does it so well! As a teacher, my wife does a lot of high volume printing. Print speed and ink cartridge life are paramount. This printer delivers. While your average inkjet printer will deliver 7 pages per minute, this one shoots pages out at 20+ per minute. Even at high resolution settings, it's still 3X as fast as any other injet we have. Two sided printing is slower as it takes a small break after printing the first side to allow the ink to dry before running the page through for side 2.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Print cartridges reportedly hold about 10ml color and 20ml black. They last a very long time. They can also be refilled if you choose to do so. If you do use recycled or refilled cartridges, just push ""OK"" when the printer points out you're not using a genuine or refilled HP cartridge. I've found unplugging newer HP printers, while removing and refilling cartridges, eliminates those warnings all together. Probably depends what firmware is on board.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Setup was easy and only took a few minutes to get the printer on our wireless network and available to all 5 computers in the house.

It's priced to compete with similarly priced NAD, Rotel, and Parasound offerings, but frankly, it's in a different galaxy from those products.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Before expressing more praise for this amplifier, however, I have to provide an account of my experience with it. I was an early purchaser of the JOB 225, and like a number of other early purchasers of this amplifier, I had a problem with 60 Hz hum emanating from the loudspeakers. When I contacted JOB Electronics (apparently a marque of the ultra-high-end brand Goldmund), the company at first seemed skeptical that there was a problem with the amplifier.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Once JOB/Goldmund acknowledged the problem, however, the response was swift. JOB paid for return shipping to Switzerland and had my amplifier back in my possession within two business days. The problem with 60 Hz hum was gone. Reportedly, other users with humming JOB 225s will be able to ship their amplifiers to a service center in NYC for repair/modification.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The repaired/modified JOB 225 sounds spectacularly transparent. Adding this amp to my system has expanded soundstage width and depth, and increased image specificity.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Before purchasing this amp, keep in mind both that output power is limited and that the amp generates a lot of heat. Use with electrostatic or other difficult-to-drive speakers should be ruled out. Use with truly high-end speakers nevertheless appears possible. One user has reported extraordinary results with TAD CR-1s.<|SEP|><|SEP|>In all, I'm pleased with my purchase. I would have rated it five stars if not for the initial 60 Hz hum problem.<|SEP|><|SEP|>NOTE ON SHIPPING: Though Amazon reports an estimated delivery time several weeks away, I and all other JOB 225 users with whom I've communicated received our amps in a couple of business days via FedEx International Priority.

Includes White Padded Cozy + 2 Carrying Handle + Downloadable eBook Recipe,Excellent Infuser Bottle from an Excellent Company,"The new bottle that I received is excellent! No issues at all, same beautiful design, and came with the same extra accessories. THE best infuser bottle that I have ever used. I am beyond satisfied with the service. Thank you! I first gave this bottle a 3-star review when I received it. The bottle was wobbly (unstable when placed on a flat surface), and it was leaky. A representative contacted me through e-mail, concerned about my experience with the product. Apologizing and assuring that all of their bottles go through leak testing and quality control, he really wanted to see how the bottle was leaking. He kindly asked me if I can send him a video of the leaking bottle, and wanted to send me a new bottle. Once he saw the video of the bottle, he sincerely apologized over and over again and said this bottle should have never passed quality control. I received a defective bottle, and hey, it happens, and it happens all the time even with big companies. Not everyone and everything is perfect. I understand that as a small company, one defective product can impact the business and it can be very frustrating. I loved how this company handled this issue. They handled it like I would have handled my own business if I were the owner. They are very professional and I highly recommend them. Thanks again!"

It is a very nice sunny blond. It should work for blond yellow cosplays.<|SEP|>It is nice and full, and the wig-cap inside it is tightly woven and lace at the crown, making it an easy wig to sew into if that treatment is needed for a costume.

It does adjust inside.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The hair is quite natural looking - my natural blond hair is in picture beside it - it compares very well to natural hair, it is just a bit shinier.<|SEP|>It’s easy to comb and work with.

It has retained it’s out of box waviness well for me.<|SEP|><|SEP|>It should fit most adults. It fits me perfectly and I am a cap size MEDIUM with a head diameter of 22.5.” It would stretch a bit more if needed. It does have straps so it will adjust down to about a 21”. I think any smaller than that would need a smaller long wig.<|SEP|><|SEP|>It can be pinned if needed as the hair is a bit weighty from length, but generally it stays on very well, but it might need a few pins if you plan on being active. That’s normal for long wigs. You’d want to use blond ones with this wig. The bangs cover the hairline well.<|SEP|><|SEP|>As I mentioned, it is a bit weighty in the back from length - blonde bobby pins will help secure it if needed. I recommend them for us with this wig."

The small leaves of the mesquite are acidic. The tree and the oleander bushes outlining the neighbor’s yard make gardening a challenge.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The botonist’s recommended adding a humic acid solution to the soil. He showed me a $26 for a diluted liter with other ingredients. I held my breath, waited to get home and checked Amazon.<|SEP|><|SEP|>I found this 2lb Terra Vita SP-90 and the reviews hinted a mixture with Azomite. I made a 1:1 mixture in a jar of Humic Acid and Azomite. I put about 2 teaspoons in a 2-gallon watering can and watered my roses, figs, pomogrante, lavender, peppers, tomatoes, chard, peas, artichokes, romenesco brocholi, and everything else in sight. Then I forgot about it. About a week later I noticed that I had a lot of leaves on the fig trees. A lot, like about 5x as many leaves from the week before; and I’m seeing fig buds. Everything else started picking up too. Now it’s spring and I expect that plants will start perking up and growing. I realized that I had not started watering the Plumaria because it hadn’t started leaving and I thought it was dying. So I watered it with the solution 2 days ago. It is leafing too.

I chose white for the 30 and 45 minute increments.)<|SEP|><|SEP|>It is quiet. No annoying ticking. And the alarm is loud and not the kind you'll ignore.

It's very Zen-like and helps you actually forget time but be mindful when it's time to stop. But yes, if you look closely, near the on/off switch there is a small minute counter.

10996,__label2__,4,N,Wireless,B00NM9OC46,Belkin Classic Case / Folio for iPhone 6 / 6S (Blacktop),Nice and functional folio case,"This is a nice folio type case for the iPhone 6. The matte cover has a smooth, rubberized and non-slippery feel to it. The iPhone is securely snapped in a built-in plastic cradle inside. The ring/silent switch, volume buttons, headphone jack and lightning connector are fully exposed, which means any third party lightning cable with a bigger connector should be able to plug in without obstruction. The interior of the front cover has a slot for storing a couple of credit cards and driver license (any more cards would make it uneven and too bulky).<|SEP|><|SEP|>Another great feature is that the folio case can be converted into a stand for the iPhone (in landscape mode). The back cover folds back a little for the phone cradle to stand on the interior of the front cover. It works pretty well when you want to watch a video clip or use video chatting. In addition, the back has a nice, clean oval cutout for the rear camera and flash.<|SEP|><|SEP|>I like this folio case for the added protection against drops since the phone cradle is recessed from the outer edges of the folio covers. The extra margin helps absorb impact from a drop. On the other hand, this makes the case slightly longer and wider than the iPhone. It in turn makes an already large, hard-to-pocket iPhone 6 even harder to put in a pocket.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Overall, this is a sleek, great looking folio case. I really like the simplicity design with a slot for a credit card and driver license (which are probably what you'll need to carry with you for most days), and that it can double up as a stand for easy viewing on a table. It also protects the large touchscreen well with its cover. It may not be truly pocketable, but it certainly protects the iPhone well."

17505,__label2__,4,Y,Kitchen,B004NBYAEE,"Bodum Brazil 1-Liter 34-Ounce French Press Coffeemaker, Green",French Press coffee is ALWAYS better,"I just retired my Keurig after two years of use. I didn't want to buy another one, because the Keurig started malfunctioning just about a year after I bought it, I was tired of buying expensive K-cups, and I missed the treat of french press coffee made with fair trade, organic freshly ground beans. So, I ordered this french press in green and some beans from my favorite purveyor, DeansBeans.com. Overall, this is a good french press. Don't expect your coffee to stay warm with any french press, as a warning. They are made to brew the coffee, not keep it warm. After brewing, press the coffee and then transfer to a carafe or thermos to keep warm. My only gripe with this coffee press is that for me the press doesn't extend down far enough. The press part stops at about the point where the green lines the bottom of the glass container. I rarely make a full press worth of coffee, so I know I'm wasting coffee because the press won't go down far enough to separate it from the grounds. Knowing that I mostly only brew about 8 ounces at a time, I probably should have just got a smaller press, but I wanted one that could handle more for when I have company. I guess you can't have everything, but I really do wish that they would have made the metal pole on the filter just a bit longer so that you could still feasibly brew less coffee with less grounds and get all the coffee out of it. (If you try to brew 8 ounces, for instance, you can only get about 2 or 3 ounces out of the press...I've taken to brewing 16 ounces, which gets me about 8 ounces out of the press)"

That's when I decided I'd just get something that would get the job done inexpensively, and found this muddler. I don't think I'll be looking at muddlers again for a long while.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Several other reviews here mention the packaging on this item to be particularly heinous, and I'm delighted to report that it has been improved substantially if my shipment is any indication. There was an adequate and reasonable amount of plastic (not cling/saran style) wrapped around the muddler that was removed easily, and the sticker attached directly to the muddler was using a very amiable adhesive that didn't leave any detectable residue.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The weight of the muddler is fantastic, despite concerns that it would be too lightweight. The end used for muddling is quite sharp and won't be letting cherries or other fruit slip around much, but it isn't my favorite for more delicate ingredients like mint sprigs. In terms of appearance, the color isn't consistent, nor is the glossiness. While this won't influence your cocktail, it isn't something you want to leave out with any nicer cocktail accessories."

After using one these for a couple of days that I borrowed from my friend, I realized why these are $49 more expensive than the QC15's.<|SEP|>First of all it is more usable in public, due to is small and sleek design. I wouldn't use a pair of QC15's while walking on the street. Comparing the sound of these two, QC15's has better clarity and surround, but the bass is a little weak. QC's may not have the clairty and surround like the QC15's, but it's an on ear headphone and has a better bass response and well balanced sound, which is perfect for myself personally. I find the rechargeable battery in the QC3's more convenient than the AAA sized batteries in the QC15's. For instance, u run out of batteries in the middle of the night, it wouldn't be very convenient to go out and get batteries, whereas u have the convenience to recharge ur QC3 batteries almost anywhere.<|SEP|>I rate the sound, design and ease of use better than the QC15's, not to say that the QC15's are bad, but if you don't mind the weaker bass and u dig the absolute crisp and clarity in a headphone and use it mostly for traveling or at home then QC15 is the way to go.

11492,__label2__,5,N,Beauty,B00NGQYU24,Key Lime Salt Scrub 13oz,luxurious and effective,"I love salt scrubs. This one is a little pricy but the container is huge so it will last you a long time. (You really don't need to use salt scrubs every day, anyway.) I generally only use them on my upper arms, because that's where I'm least happy with my skin, although there's no reason you couldn't use this all over. It has a lovely citrus (lime) scent. It separates a little when stored but the container does mention that you should mix it up before using. Shaking will not be effective -- you'll want something stiff like a knife to stir it, because it's pretty thick. Or just take the shortcut I've been using and try to get a little of the oil and a little of the solid part and mix it in your palm. I can really feel this working. One thing to watch out for -- this may sting a bit if you use it right after shaving. I use it typically at the end of a shower, after shaving under my arms, and if a little salt migrates down there, it can hurt. So just be careful where/when you apply it. (It's not bad, but it was somewhat surprising the first time I experienced the sensation, so I thought I would mention it.) The salt dissolves as you rub this around. When you rinse it off, there's a bit of residue left over, but this absorbs pretty well into the skin within a few minutes of getting out of the shower. And it's very moisturizing, even if you don't follow with a lotion. In the end, I definitely think the appearance of the skin on my upper arms has improved since I started using this. Plus, I love the smell. I'm torn as to whether to buy a different scent (so I can try them all) or get the same one again, when I run out."

It seems less useful than a Kindle Fire or an Android tablet, and there is no cost advantage. It does a number of things, but none of them really well. And it has some major flaws. The most obvious is that it has an attached stand that does not fold or adjust and is not removable. This makes it awkward to hold and to carry. It also has a battery life of only 90 minutes, so it works best as a stationary object plugged into an outlet, but then there is no advantage to it being small and light. I found it to be convenient for watching YouTube videos and listening to internet radio, and that is probably the only way I will use it. I tried Skype, but the person with whom I was Skyping said that the picture quality was very poor, so there seems to be a problem with my camera. I also tried using it for photo slideshows, but the resolution was not very good. And finally, it has an insensitive touchscreen which requires pressure for the touch to be effective.

11039,__label2__,5,N,Books,373893051,The Delight Gluten-Free Cookbook: 150 Delicious Recipes,Here's the recipes I tested and info on the special features in this cookbook. It's now a must-have for my gluten-free cooking!,"With 2 members of the family who are gluten-free, I'm always searching for new and innovative recipes. Whether you're experienced or are new to gluten-free cooking, this book would be among my top 3 choices - not only for the recipes ( you can check out the ones I tested and the results below) but some unique special features. There are instructions on how to prepare several special flour mixes.. There is also comprehensive information about many other aspects of gluten-free living. This is an impressive resource. A major asset of this book are the instructions for creating 3 special baking flour blends, each with special advantages. There is the Basic Gluten-Free All-Purpose Homemade Flour Blend. Then there is a High- Protein and Fiber All Purpose flour blend as well as another option- a High-Protein, Low -Glycemic Flour blend. These special mixes do NOT appear on any store shelves and are only in this book. Listed below are the results of a round of testing recipes and the results. Below that is a section on the special features of this book. The author is an active member of the advisory board of the Celiac Disease Program at Children's National Medical Center as well as the executive editor of Delight Gluten-Free magazine. I do think it is important to note that if you are following a low-calorie or low-fat diet, you will need to keep a CLOSE eye on the calorie and fat counts per serving. Many are high. Even so, I found that by making a few simple substitutions . I could lower calories and fat to acceptable levels. However, the recipes I tested for this review have NOT been altered or tweaked from the original instructions. Also, there are a fair number of recipes here that are reasonably low in calories. These include: Veggie Pizza, Crab and Oyster Mushroom Bisque, Gazpacho salad, Spiced Kale Chips, Stuffed Mushrooms (Lemon, Ricotta and Kale filling) On to the recipes: Here's what we made on Day 1: We started with Herbed Hummus, anice mixture of garbanzo beans, tahini, olive oil, lemon juice, basil leaves, cilantro leaves, parsley, chives, and garlic. It was incredible, eaten on its own or served with gluten-free crackers. This is a recipe which is easily tweaked a bit so if you hate cilantro, as some do, add a bit more parsley or adjust to taste. We followed the recipe just as written. We devoured it within an hour. Next on the agenda? Another appetizer, Baked Potato Chips with Parsley, Garlic and Sea Salt. This is an easy snack recipe to prepare and clean-up is minimal, especially if you have parchment paper on hand to line the baking sheets (as recommended by the author) These chips could also be a side dish with dinner. They had a nice depth of flavors, and the simple additions of garlic and parsley were just the right touches. You can modify this one easily to accommodate your favorite spices. Moving on to dinner: we made Green Beans with Tomatoes, Garlic, and Onions. We had fresh green beans and tomatoes waiting to be used. It took less than 15 minutes to pull this one together (not counting time to remove the ends from the fresh green beans) . Fresh green beans, onions, garlic and a touch of red pepper flakes. Delish! Then came Pan- Seared Chicken Cutlets with Mushroom Gravy. Took minutes to make and the gravy turned simple chicken cutlets into a gourmet dish. We wanted a simple dessert for the meal's finish so we went with the Flan de Coco, easily made with staple ingredients found in our refrigerator and pantry. Very satisfying. We didn't have time to cook many breads except for quick breads. The Peach Yogurt Quick Bread was a smash hit - as were the Oatmeal Pancakes and the Buttermilk Cheddar Breakfast Biscuits. I'm particularly interested in seeing how the sandwich bread turns out and will update this review then. To be honest, by the time we got to breads I was feeling too tired to tackle more. Special features of this cookbook: In addition to the standardinfo about foods which contain gluten, there is an extensive list of gluten-free ingredients, safe food additives, unsafe foods,etc. The info on Food Labeling Laws in the United States was helpful for me as well as special tips on ""Navigating the Grocery Store for Home Cooking"" ."

I had a good experience mounting it with this http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B000WYVBR0 Tried different angles and the viewing was good or excellent in almost all. Samsung for some reason have this idea to have a light in their T.V's front side when they are off. this one has a little red light that does not bother me at all. Other Samsung TV I have has a giant blue light that it is annoying if you have the T.V in the bedroom. why they add this lights is a mystery to me you know when the T.V is off and On, has image TV ON, Not image TV is OFF, as simple as that. Some people also complain that this is not the thinnest T.V either well unless you are going to set it in a razor thin wall the difference between 3.5&#34; and 1.5&#34; in back space is meaningless. the deep unless you have serious space problems is useless the wide distance is in the back and you are looking at the screen from the front so who cares? I understand the difference with old TV's and the bulky back side. Having 3.5&#34; against 1.5&#34; for more $100? give me the cheaper 3.5&#34; and $100 back in my bank account. Because i am not using any external sources of sound and care too much about that in the bedroom I did not care as much about the lack of outputs for headsets or even speakers like some people in these reviews seem to care so much but if you do it is something to consider. This is the best TV for the price TV for these usages: 1. Bedroom T.V / Kids room. 2. Kitchen T.V 3. To be used as a monitor if your computer HAS a HDMI connection 4. if you use your TV ata regular volume and don't care about external sources of sound.(Speakers, headsets, sound bars). 5. You have a cable box or signal source which native resolution is 720p if you pay the extra for the 1080p the T.V image wont be any better unless you watch blue rays in a blue Ray capable DVD (Timer Warner boxes for instance have a native resolution of 720p). 6. You don't want to break the Bank to have a good quality T.V mostly for regular T.V viewing. 7.

Second, it is very bright. I live in the countryside. This flashlight can light up things within one hundred meters. Even the leaves on the trees can be clearly seen. That is really amazing. Third, I was worried about the quality of the batteries at first, but after using it on a daily basis, I found that its own 26650 batteries last for over two hours in highlight mode. This saves me a lot of bother, for example, always having to charge or take another set of batteries.

10974,__label2__,3,N,Grocery,B00F9X5FT4,"Andria's Brush On Steak Sauce, 15 Ounce",Andria's Brush-on Steak Sauce Is More Like A Soy Sauce Gravy.,"ANDRIA'S BRUSH-ON STEAK SAUCE. 15 FLUID OUNCES (450 mL). Why this is called a steak sauce, is the question of the day. It tastes like a brown brisket (not the red corned beef brisket) gravy made from boiled down beef brisket meat juice, along with the strained carrots, celery and onions. The next time I cook a brisket and run out of gravy, I can always use Andria's instead. Andria's is not a steak sauce, it is a brisket style gravy, with added soy sauce. The label mentions marinating a steak in it, and brushing it on a steak during cooking. Maybe I will use it if I overcook a steak until it is dry and brown inside like a brisket, -otherwise, no thank you. Andria's is also a bit salty, and contains 400 mg of salt per tablespoon, about what you would get in a hotdog, and hotdogs are considered salty to begin with. People with high blood pressure and on a low salt diet may want to avoid this sauce altogether. Andria's also contains soybeans, giving it a bit of a soy sauce flavor. It might be suitable for use on Chinese food in place of regular soy sauce, but not for use on a steak. As far as I am concerned, this is fifteen ounces of expensive gravy or soy sauce. Be careful when pouring, as the bottle does not have a soy sauce shaker top, and you can easily dump it out all at once. The Nutrition Facts and INGREDIENTS as listed on the label are as follows: Nutrition Facts: Serving Size 1 tbsp (15 g), Servings per container 30. Amount Per Serving: Calories 10 (Calories from fat 0), Total Fat 0 g (Saturated Fat 0 g, Trans Fat 0 g), Sodium 400 mg, Total Carbohydrate 2 g (Sugars 1 g), Protein 0 g. INGREDIENTS: Water, Onions, Garlic, Wheat, Soybeans, Salt, Caramel, Carrots, Celery, Parsnips, Turnips, Parsley, Spices, Potassium Sorbate, and Potassium Benzoate, Phosphoric Acid, Dextrose, Silicon Diaxide added to preserve freshness (Dioxide? Their spelling mistake, not mine). Allergens: Contains Soybeans, Wheat, Dextrose. The EXP date is stamped in black on the top of the white bottle cap. If you walk down the supermarket aisle, and you see the label &#34;ANDRIA'S BRUSH-ON STEAK SAUCE&#34;, you naturally think that it is what it says it is, a steak sauce. You won't notice the fine print on the back label until you get home. I will type the label information exactly as it is on the back label: &#34;AFTER OPENING STIR WELL KEEP REFRIGERATED For Charcoal Broiling or Oven Broiling, Baking, or Grilling. Also add to Ground Meats, Stews, and Gravies. Can be Used as a Microwave Browning Agent. BRUSH-ON Before and During Cooking Beef, Chops, Hamburger, Roasts, Meat loafs, Etc. Also Excels as a Marinade.&#34; It may be a matter of definitions, but in my best attempt to decipher the purpose of this sauce, it is a marinade that you put on meat prior to cooking, and it can also be used as a basting &#34;Browning Agent&#34; during cooking to keep the meat from drying out. It also mentions adding it to gravies, which makes sense, as this sauce tastes like a gravy already. If this sauce is really meant for cooking, it should not, I repeat, not, mention steak sauce on the front label. A steak sauce is something that you put on your steak after it is cooked and placed on your plate, regardless of whether you choose to brush it on or pour it on. I hope that this note has helped folks to clear up any confusion that they might have as to what ANDRIA'S BRUSH-ON STEAK SAUCE really is. Purist human carnivores even prefer making do with a little salt and black pepper on their steak. Myself, I prefer adding a steak sauce, and this Andria's sauce is definitely not a steak sauce.

I went ahead and ordered it, but was prepared for splinters by having bought some duct tape (as suggested by reviewers) to cover the pole with. However, tape was not necessary because the pole looks and feels like smooth, flexible plastic. This is the ""original"" toy and pole, so perhaps only the later models are made of fiberglass??<|SEP|><|SEP|>This Da Bird Super Pack is a good deal, with 5 toys altogether (1 on the pole + 3 refills + the peacock feather which is so long by itself that it doesn't have (or need) anything to fasten it to the pole because it can be used on its own. For the price, including shipping, this was the best deal I've seen.<|SEP|><|SEP|>My cat was a stray, and hasn't been with me for long, and it is a major adjustment for her to be indoors all the time after having roamed freely for an unknown period of time. I really want her to have fun, mental stimulation, and exercise, so I was thrilled to see her play with Da Bird yesterday. What's nice about this is that she can catch it often which keeps her interested - unlike the Loco Laser which is just a tease that she can never catch and therefore has lost interest in. She only plays with her Midnight Crazies balls and her catnip mice for very brief spells. With Da Bird she has all the behaviors & excitement of chasing real prey, and plenty of exercise. Since the toy mimics live prey, I suspect she will remain interested in it. Will post if she doesn't.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Reviewers are also correct in that the attachments come apart easily. The largest feather already fell off yesterday. I'm saving it to use with other feathers that will eventually fall off, and will make a new toy out of them.<|SEP|><|SEP|>With this set having newly arrived, I haven't yet tried the other attachments or the peacock feather, and am trying to ""stretch"" them by using one at a time until each one is worn out...<|SEP|><|SEP|>For the enjoyment and exercise this has given my cat, and the price of the Super Pack, I'm giving it 5 stars even though the feather has already fallen off."

If you use them for an extended period of time and you pound on the drums, the rubber might rub off on the drum. My only complaint is that it doesn't 100% resemble the bounce of a real drum head; and if I practice too long on these, my sticks are flying in the air because I need to adjust to the bounce of a real head.

The system looks clean and goes well with my 46 inch Samsung. The remote that came with the speakers worked with my TV right out of the box -- and I like it better than my stock TV remote so I'll be using the new one from now on.

I've been listening to music/movies for the last 4 hours and here's what I've noticed so far...<|SEP|><|SEP|>Low Levels<|SEP|> - Since the sub is so weak, you'll have to turn the sub to the highest setting if you really want to feel it in your bones. And when you crank a speaker up to the highest volume, you almost never get a clean sound. It's not HORRIBLE, but I feel like SAMSUNG really could have satisfied people a lot more if they included a more powerful sub. For movies it's not so bad, but the bass isn't crisp and sharp with songs that have a lot of kicks or 808's with low frequencies.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Mids/Highs<|SEP|> - The range of the actual sound bar itself is incredible...there's a real distinction between the mid/lower and highest frequencies which are all driven out at different angles so they hit your ears to closely resemble a 5.1 system. I did notice slight clipping noises when the upper range hit higher volumes though -- hopefully this will go away after the speakers get broken in. The sound really is beautiful though and I'm happy with the look/sound of the bar.<|SEP|><|SEP|>I'll definitely enjoy these for now but I'm not impressed with the sub. I'm waiting for Vizio to release their new system which is supposed to be the next best thing since sliced bread. I'll compare the two and pick whichever ends up sounding better...but for now the E450's will be a huge upgrade from my stock TV speakers."

So far it works great in every application I throw at it.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Most projectors matching the specs of this one are a few hundreds dollars more. You can maybe find some with a higher lumen output, but that alone is definitely not worth paying several hundred more than this one. The value this one has for its price is unheard of. Full 1080p HD, 3D support, high lumen output, more video inputs/ports than I will ever need, HDMI 1.4a spec, low bulb replacement cost, black finish (most are white). These were all good selling points I was looking for, and coupled with the great price, pushed me to purchase this model.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The quality of the video output is great. It can be substantially improved from its default settings by using an AV optimization DVD or something along those lines though. I can use the projector with the lights on too if necessary, but it obviously looks much worse than it does when the lights are off and windows completely covered.<|SEP|><|SEP|>I like having a good choice of inputs in case I need to connect it to an older laptop or game console, or basically anything without HDMI. But as I have a pretty good AV receiver, I use that to manage all my various connections, so I only use the HDMI 1 input. But since it's the HDMI 1.4a spec, it can handle 3D and any gaming situation I give it. It should be at least moderately future-proof.<|SEP|><|SEP|>One other little bonus gem (feature I didn't know existed until after I set it up) is that you can remove the Optoma logo on start-up and replace it with your own. Totally unnecessary for most people, but I thought that was awesome,so I sketched out a sweet home theater logo with our family name and custom graphics, just to (attempt) to impress visitors that use it. I'm probably the only one who will really think that's cool, but whatever.<|SEP|><|SEP|>There aren't a lot of things I don't like about this projector, but since it's not perfect I will explain. The remote feels like very low-quality cheap made-in-China garbage. It works, so I can't complain too much, but it's one of the worst-looking and feeling remotes I've ever used. Fortunately, all I really need to for was initial setup options, and to turn it on and off. I will probably also program my AV receiver remote to work with the projector also, so I won't need to use the Optoma one at all.<|SEP|><|SEP|>It's tricky getting all four corners perfectly in focus. When I get the top perfectly in focus, the bottom gets slightly blurry, and vice-versa.<|SEP|><|SEP|>I also would have really liked an ethernet port or some kind of network connectivity like my TVs all have. But I can't deduct a star for lacking that feature, since for the price range I'm already getting far more than any other projectors have. I didn't want to pay double the price for slightly higher lumens and an ethernet port that certain other models offered.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The projector isn't totally silent, but it is definitely an acceptable level of noise. You can hear the fan if you are trying to listen for it, but it's not distracting or annoying like how deafeningly loud my original Xbox 360 and PS3 were.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The last thing I'm not thrilled about is how expensive the 3D glasses are. I have six pairs of active 3D glasses for my Samsung smart TV, so me and any family/friends/visitors can all watch in 3D at the same time. The TV included four and extra pairs are not unreasonably priced. At a hundred bucks MSRP, or even, amazon's 25% lower price, for EACH one, I definitely cannot describe them as affordable. I'd like to eventually get four, but I just don't know if I'll ever be able to justify the price since it's mostly just me and my wife watching stuff on it. I rarely go 3rd-party on electronics, but I may look into getting some cheaper glasses that don't have the Optoma name, if I can get them for half the price of Optoma's.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Overall though, very happy with this purchase. The only thing left to see is how well the lamp holds up. I'm hoping I won't have to replace it for a long time, but fortunately, the bulb replacement cost on this one is lower than most, which is another great reason to consider this projector."

11397,__label2__,4,N,Video DVD,B0008KLVA0,Prime Cut (1972),Kind of proto-Tarantino half serious crime movie about Irish mobsters saving damsels in distress from an evil redneck crime lord,"I rather liked this weird, shocking and less than half-serious 1972 crime film, even if it is not exactly a masterpiece. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS. Irish mob bosses from Chicago have a problem - one of their business partners, known as Mary Ann (Gene Hackman) owes them money - in fact A LOT of money - and not only he obstinately refuses to pay, but treats most unkindly all those who are send to collect. Mary Ann lives on a farm near Kansas City and officially makes his money in cattle slaughtering and meat packaging, but in fact he is a dangeorus and vicious crime lord, ruling his rural neighborhood almost as a feodal duke. Having received loud and clear (by mail) Mary Ann's latest unequivocal (and, in a way, very tasty) refusal to pay, Chicago mob bosses decide to send in another crew of debt collectors - this time more numerous and especially headed by a particularly vicious enforcer, Nick Devlin (Lee Marvin). Other than 50.000 dollars fee Devlin is also incited to take this offer by the oportunity of revenge - indeed, between him and Mary Ann there is considerable beef (sorry, I couldn't resist)... And then the film really begins. This film mixes elements of: - gangster movie, as there is lots of gangsters - film noir, as there is a femme not only fatale but ""tres fatale"" - western, as there are gunfights and chases in a very rural environment, and also lots of chattel (both four and two legged), shotguns and hats, - parody, as the two bad guys, both muy macho, are called Mary Ann and Weenie...))) - soft porn, as for most of the film young Sissy Spacek, for whom it was the first role ever, (and who is cute like a button and absolutely delicious as a damsel in distress) runs completely naked, full frontal included... We also learn a lot about intimate life of little orphan girls who never saw a man... - promotion of vegetarianism becasue CLASSIFIED TO AVOID SPOILERS - but believe me, you will probably not want a steak or a sausage for some time after watching ""Prime Cut"" - child movie (SPOILER WARNING HERE), as at one moment murderous gangsters with machine guns will mount on the white horse (OK, in fact get in a black car - but metaphorically speaking it is true) to save a virgin princess kept in a tower and later a lot of poor orphans from a bad, bad, bad lady... As we can see, the coctail is indeed exotic and sometimes surrealistic - in fact it reminds me a little bit of Quentin Tarantino scenarios... This film contains some deliberately very shocking scenes, including a slave auction - it certainly made a splash in 1972 - all rhytmed by a very good musical score by Lalo Shiffrin. Action scenes however aged a lot and are rather boring and the great finale showdown is very, very disappointing. Dialogs are a mixture of good one liners and smart come backs, but also sadly some banalities. Finally, actions of the bad guys finally don't make much sense and for that reason the frontal shock between Lee Marvin and Gene Hackman doesn't deliver as much as it could be expected. But still it is an interesting film, with two excellent actors, a cute (and naked) damsel in distress, some shocking moments, some good dialogs, a femme (tres) fatale and, let's say it again, a lot of beef... ENJOY!"

10850,__label2__,1,N,Books,761452915,Exiled: Memoirs of a Camel,"a bit mature for children, and heavy on Islam indoctrination","I was torn on how to review this book. On one hand, the book is a page turner, but as a children's book (or at least children's reading level), it's hard not to be a page-turner... on the other hand, the references to the Q'uran and Allah were nearly on every single page. It was over the top. I do not have a problem with children being exposed to other cultures or other religions - but this was not exposure - this was non-stop praise for Allah. Each chapter opens with a quote from the Q'uran and nearly every page has either a person or a camel praising Allah. I don't know if it was put in there to try to add realism to the story, but it was so emphasized, it made itself way too obvious. It was a distraction to the story. I was interested in reading this book when I read the description because of the history of the US Camel Corps. I had never heard of this experiment in American history and was intrigued by the story. The camels were captured and sold in Egypt to the US government - so I get the names they used - many of which were the authentic names of actual camels and people involved in the Camel Corps. The camels bowing to pray to Allah was a bit much. Even without the non-stop indoctrination (seriously - nearly every page), the content was a bit intense for young readers. The book is listed as for grades 4-8. Even without addressing the all-Allah-all-the-time references, the subject matter seems to be beyond what I'd feel comfortable with even a 7th grader reading. Camels mating, camels killing each other, and the Egyptian cameleer anxious to go into town to get to the prostitutes. Seriously? I'm not sure what the editors were thinking and why they didn't rein some of this in. The story of the US Camel Corps is one that needs to be told - I just think there's a better way to tell this story to young children. When looking at the book as a whole - it's goal to tell the story to children, it fails as it is too mature and heavy on religious indoctrination - whether or not that was the intent of the author."

11193,__label2__,4,Y,Video DVD,B00D97DMBU,Scanners II: The New Order / Scanners III: The Takeover (BluRay/DVD Combo) [Blu-ray],"Telekinetic Horror Presented in Awesome Widescreen; Unfortunately, No Extras!","****No Plot Spoilers****<|SEP|><|SEP|> Ever since watching Brian De Palma's ""Carrie"" ([[ASIN:B0047E9TRA Carrie]]) and ""The Fury"" ([[ASIN:B000G6BLO2 The Fury]]), I've been obsessed with telekinesis. The Scanners franchise also fulfilled my desire to watch people move objects with their thoughts. The original ""Scanners"" ([[ASIN:B00005K3NY Scanners]]) was directed by David Cronenberg who became famous for his controversial science fiction horror films starring controversial actors [e.g., ""The Brood"" ([[ASIN:B00009PY2T The Brood]]), with brawler hunk Oliver Reed, and ""Rabid"" ([[ASIN:B0001XAKUQ Rabid]]) with former porn star Marilyn Chambers]. ""Scanners"" focuses on an emotionally disturbed, homeless scanner, Cameron Vale (Stephen Lack) who meets an art gallery assistant, Kim Obrist (supermodel Jennifer O'Neill) who is also a scanner. Together, they attempt to locate an evil scanner, Darryl Revok (Michael Ironside), who wants the scanners to rule the world. During their quest, they discover the dark secret concerning the origin of scanners. Note: Scanners not only have the ability to move objects with their thoughts, but they can also read (i.e., scan) and manipulate other people's thoughts. However, many become insane because of sensory overload.<|SEP|><|SEP|> Having owned ""Scanners"" on DVD for years, I was naturally thrilled to learn that Shout Factory had released its first two sequels as a Blu-Ray and DVD combo pack. I saw them on VHS too many years ago in muted, full-frame formats. Thanks to Shout Factory, each film has been presented correctly in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.78:1. All colors are bright, clear and crisp and the audio is great (DTS-HD Master Audio Stereo for Blu-Ray; Dolby Digital Stereo for DVD). Each film appears as though it has been recently released at the theatre. There are no vertical lines or dark splotches. I played the DVD version on my Blu-Ray player and couldn't tell a significant difference from the Blu-Ray. The remastering for both the Blu-Ray and the DVD has been excellent. I`ll be able to loan the DVD to my girlfriend, Tammy, who doesn't own a Blu-Ray player. A horror buff like me, she's going to kill me with her evil thoughts when she learns I watched these films without her.<|SEP|><|SEP|> Both Scanners II and III were directed by Christian Duguay. Like ""Scanners,"" they boast gorgeous casts, contain themes of good versus evil and were filmed in and around the cold, gray environs of Montreal and Quebec, Canada. In ""Scanners II: The New Order,"" a veterinarian student, David Kellum (David Hewitt) is a scanner on the run who finds another scanner, Julie Vale (Deborah Raffin); together they try to destroy the corrupt Commander John Forrester (Yvan Potton) who is using scanners to kill anyone who stands in his way of becoming mayor. Similar in plot to the original ""Scanners,"" it has, however, some shocking twists. Also, it has considerably more gore and violence than the original. This one was more emotionally disturbing to me because it deals more with violence perpetrated against family members.<|SEP|><|SEP|> In ""Scanners III: The Takeover,"" a Christmas tragedy causes a scanner, Alex Monet (Steve Parrish), to become a monk in Thailand. Meanwhile, his sister, Helena (Liliana Komorowska), also a scanner, is suffering from severe migraine. She uses her father's experimental drug and becomes insanely diabolical. She then commandeers her father's pharmaceutical company to take over the world. As in the previous film, there is a tremendous amount of violence and gore. Again, there is familial violence; this time, it is even sadder when relatives attempt to kill one another. Note: I loved the unforgettable character of Helena. She is extremely diabolical, beautiful and sensual. Komorowska played her perfectly.<|SEP|><|SEP|> There are two discs in this Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack. One disc contains both films on DVD and the other disc contains both films on Blu-Ray. Unfortunately, the combo pack doesn't have any extras. There are no subtitles, no audio commentaries, no theatrical trailers, no deleted scenes, no ""making off featurettes,"" and, worst of all, no scene selections. The menu gives you a choice of which Scanners movie to watch and that is all. Unbelievable! If not for the widescreen presentations, stereo audio and remastering, I would have thought that these two films had been released by Mill Creek, which churns out films on Blu-Ray and DVD at a high rate, regardless of quality. Because of its blatant lack of extras, I cannot give this Scanners II and III Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack the highest rating.<|SEP|><|SEP|> If you are a fan of horror films, especially the ones involving telekinesis, then I recommend this Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack. However, I wish Shout Factory had either included a digital copy or just decreased the price and given us the choice of buying the Blu-Ray or the DVD, not both. I also wish that Shout Factory or another company would properly release ""Scanner Cop"" and ""Scanner Cop 2: Volkin's Revenge"" on Blu-Ray. Both films star Daniel Quinn as Detective Samuel Staziak who hunts down rogue scanners. The original ""Scanners,"" released by MGM and out of print at the time of this review, also deserves the Blu-Ray treatment. Many fans are hoping it will be re-released by the Criterion Collection. My MGM release of ""Scanners"" only has a theatrical trailer and subtitles for extras. A commentary from David Cronenberg would be nice.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Joseph B. Hoyos"

The main compartment is a little too small for a jacket and the side pockets won't hold much more than a tube and lever.

10817,__label2__,5,N,Baby,B00HAZSBIG,Munchkin Bath Fun Bubble Blower Toy,Redesign seems to have done the trick...,"My toy arrived and I admit I had some frustration getting it out of the packaging, this little bird was tied in TIGHT. I'm glad I didn't alert my little one that it had arrived because he would have had to wait a LONG time for me to first get the thing out of the packaging and then try to get the battery cover off to get the batteries in. Once I had achieved that herculean task though, operation couldn't have been more smooth. There's a little button for off and on at the top of birdies' head and that's all it takes for him to start up the fun after you add the bubble solution. You can use any type of bubble solution you like undiluted. I found that this does actually seem to be best for the tub or barring that, outdoors because of the wetness factor. I personally would NEVER use this indoors except in the tub. It does tend to get wet underneath and around the unit, so if that is going to be an issue just place it on top of a towel or something like that. Really - I think that is why this is labeled as a ""tub toy"" primarily. It works well and delights children. I had no issues with the operation of it. Especially boisterous youngsters may accidentally knock this over if using this outside without aid of the suction cup.... so supervision might be in order. EDIT 2-17-15 Still working well on original set of batteries. I do note that if you don't empty out the bubble stuff each time or run it out that it will leak out. We have just taken to leaving this permanently in the bathroom tub on the ledge so it's not that big a deal but worth noting if you want to conserve your bubbles or think you might be returning to ""use them later"". I also note that when we switched bubble brands to a cheaper one we can't use it continually for more than five minutes at a time.... we have to let the bird ""rest"" because the bubbles get too thick and sudzy and it can't spit them out as well. So if we turn it off for a few minutes then turn it on again that seemsto do the trick. We could go back to using the more expensive bubbles.... but since our system works and our 4 year old seems ok with our explanation of the bird needing to ""rest"" it doesn't seem to pressing to pay more money."

12047,__label2__,4,Y,PC,B00422XOEG,Archos 70 - 250 GB Internet Tablet (Black),"Initially was very impressed, but had issues","Archos 70 250GB is an awesome device with known limitations. I have been searching for a large capacity mp3 style player. I have tried iPod Classic, too small screen for my taste. iPhone 32GB is small for my music/video collection. Having used iPhone 3GS and Nexus One Android 2.1/2.2, I have been thinking of any OS tablet style device. 7"" is excellent for my requirement. While searching I stumbled on Archos 70/101 line and I was amazed they had a 250 GB hard disk model! Salient points/comments/improvements for Archos 70 250 GB model: Form factor is great, weight is not an issue. You can definitely see the hard disk spinning/humming slightly on the HD model. Flash model will not have this issue.It would have been great if they have this hybrid model where they have 4 GB and rest Hard disk for storage. This will speed up things definitely. A Optional SDHC card slot like in flash model will be very desirable. Since this is not Google blessed, there is no Android Google marketplace. So one has to install the hack given below in reference section. However this is very easy for people who are used to hacking/computer savvy. It may seem difficult for novice users, but it is very easy. The device/software is definitely not smooth if there are many apps running/lot of data churning. I have reboot it multiple times, but still it does not take away the usefulness of the product. As long as you don't run random apps and try one at a time install/test/remove/keep approach you are fine. When I connected the device to a PC using USB cable, it reboot and then came up and gave option to mount USB. I had no idea why it rebooted. I live with this sort of thing for past 20 years, so it is not a issue for me. The Music player capability which is my main reason for getting it. There were some bumps in the Updating Multimedia library after copying files. It detected only 900 out of 5000+ files. I did a Reset Multimedia library and it fixed the issue. Took around 0.3 seconds to scan afile. So 6000 files = 6000 * 0.3 /60 = 30 minutes. This is reasonable and ok. Everytime I add music/pictures/videos I may have to run this if it does not incrementally find files. I am not sure how Android indexing media files works. The sound quality is amazing. There are two speakers on either side of tablet in landscape mode. Skype call works and I can make phone calls from this. This is very handy. Youtube is great, playback is good. I have only 802.11g, and wifi connectivity is good. I have powersave set to Overdrive. Gaming experience is great. Angry Birds! I am not playing games involving lot of accelerometer as moving device vigorously will affect hard disk. I am curious how hard disk is caged and sealed to device. Still moving head is a concern. I am not a big gamer of action/arcade games, so it is not a deal breaker for me. My main reason for getting this is storage! I had all 90GB of music in lala.com and Apple acquired and killed the service. Accessories: NOOKcolor eBook Pocket case cover, Bluetooth GPS Receivers, Phone for tethering or MiFi make it complete. Case/Google Navigation/Always on mobile. I tether to my Nexus One using portable hotspots which is a froyo feature. With its limitations it is good. I wish they polish those 20% of areas and make it a good device."

6489,__label1__,5,N,Office Products,B00H0FJLZS,"Smead Cascading Wall Organizer, 6 Pockets, Letter Size, Gray/Bright (92060)",This is absolutely PERFECT for exactly what I wanted,"This is absolutely PERFECT for exactly what I wanted. In my very small space I don't have room for a file cabinet. I wanted a wall system to file my active project folders, and happy colors to brighten up the space. At the same time, it is relatively flat against the wall/roof so it doesn't crowd my desk space or my elbow. It is easy to access the folders and return them to their resting place, so it keeps my desk clear and my visual space (and mind) uncluttered. Then I can collect it into a compact package so I can carry it to a better heated space when the weather is so cold it gets too drafty in my attic office. Did I mention that my attic walls are slanted? The folders don't fall out. The material is a poly type, so someday I expect that the corners might get brittle an crack a little, but I imagine by then I will be ready for a bit of decorative change--I figure that's what washi tape is for. The colorful liners DO come with the system."

12032,__label2__,5,Y,Home Improvement,B00947YBV4,Fancierstudio 60W 5500K Compact Fluorescent Light,"Cool operation, bright and excellent color","I shoot classical guitar videos for my YouTube channel and use softboxes for diffusion. Diffusion materials absorb a lot of photons so a bright light is essential. FancierStudio claims their 60 watt CFL is as bright as a 300 watt incandescent light bulb, so I bought four and took the FancierStudio 60 Watt CFL for a test run in my studio. This is a large CFL but fits fine in a small 16&#34; x 16&#34; softbox, e.g., the [[ASIN:B00OTG6474 Neewer 16x16&#34; Wired Softbox]] I use as a hair light or fill light (I use 105W CFLs for key). Probably not a good choice for household use as it’s too large for most fixtures. After a few minutes of warmup, it's blazing bright and has excellent color clarity. It's rated at 5500K and, indeed, is close to daylight temperature but leans to the cool side with a mild green tint. Not that can’t be handled by a minor WB tweak. For still images, I have to compensate for the green spike by pulling the tint slider to the magenta side. I expected an 60 watt CFL to run hot but, strangely enough, runs cooler than the small CFLs I use around the house. The larger size is more efficient at dissipating heat than compact CFLs. I own 60 watt CFLs from FancierStudio, KAEZI, ALZO, Neewer and others and they're all the same, right down to the green stripe and generic white box. I suspect they're all made in the same Chinese factory and are simply rebranded by vendors. This is a great CFL: bright, cool running and reasonably true to color. I ordered a couple more to keep as backups. 4/18/2015 update: It's been about four months since I started using these CFLs and have shot hundreds of hours of video and stills using these CFLs and they've been 100% reliable."

The first &#34;Tennis racket of Death&#34; that was sent to me was defective. It happens. The company then sent a replacement but it was an AA model and not the one I ordered which was the C cell. I bought an older farmhouse and needed this for the bugs that are there. Which at this time of year consist of Cluster Flies and Asian Lady Beetles. The AA model took like 6 hits to kill a cluster fly. Sometimes they would drop on the ground and get up fairly quickly. Asian Lady Beetle which sort of look like a ladybug but aren't, tnded to die after being zapped a couple of times.<|SEP|>Once the C cell model arrived Cluster flies would die in 1-2 zaps and ALB's would die with one hit. If you've never dealt with either of these pests they are super annoying and can get into the tiniest of spaces. Cluster flies will ply dead by laying on their backs and hide in cracks so tiny you can't figure out how they fit. Lady beetles are worse. When the light and heat comes on these bugs come out in force and both will bite. I fully expected these bugs to explode like popcorn but they are super tough as well as clever. They will walk rather than fly. No idea how this will work on wasps or hornets but will find out in the spring.<|SEP|>If you want something that kills quick you really need the bigger model. For stuff like spiders and mosquitos the AA model should work well. For hardier insects get the C cell model you will need it.<|SEP|>also be very careful if you go after web spiders. The webs can make contact with the electrical contacts and it will pop and zap as if it were a bug on it. The product works well and as advertised but some bugs are tougher to kill than others and you really shouldn't kill Asian lady beetles with this because they stink pretty bad when they pop from being zapped. I accidentally killed a stink bug with this and whoo wee! did it ever smell. Lady beetles aren't as bad but they do reek when they die."

These actually make a table look beautiful, especially if you can find ones that are not square cut (although those work great too). This also makes a great hostess gift to skip the usual bottle of wine you bring as a gift, lay some cheeses out on a slate, and give them the pack of chalk markers. People go wild over that one.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Chalk is messy and dusty and unpleasant in so many ways--including breathing it. Not so here. No big nibs, no dust, no mess, no rubbing off--what you do is prime the marker by pressing the tip down until the chalk &#34;ink&#34; flows through. Then start writing!<|SEP|><|SEP|>When it's time to wipe off? A damp rag takes it all off--but it does not rub off like regular chalk otherwise.<|SEP|><|SEP|>It is far more easy to write with this. And make it look good when you do it!<|SEP|><|SEP|>It's nice to have lots of colors and be able to label the different names of cheeses etc. in different colors, or give each kid a color if you want to keep a wall planner calendar and label events for each person, another color for family events, another color for to do list etc.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Great for kids to draw on because you can give them chalkboards, they can get colorful, wipe off and start again.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Great to take a long board, spray paint it with chalkboard spray, have everyone write notes about what they love about a birthday person and have it run down the center of a table for a birthday party--nice for the photos and memories and for everyone to get to do and read.

13025,__label2__,3,N,Video DVD,B002BWP3UC,A Prophet,Extraordinary performance in an ordinary gangster movie,"I don't like gangster and prison movies as a genre, and the only thing that sets this movie apart from other such movies is Tahar Rahim's fantastic performance. Just discovering him made this movie definitely worth watching. Otherwise, it's not a particularly great or even interesting movie.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Unlike The Godfather, for example, this movie does not transcend its genre and become deeply rewarding far beyond a gangster movie. I loved Godfather despite its being a gangster movie, but A Prophet doesn't rise above its material.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Also (and this may seem petty, but it's my review so I can write whatever I want to), there's a really annoying song about midway through by some singer doing a Bob Dylan imitation. Another reviewer thought it WAS Dylan and praised the movie for using his song, but that person must never have heard the real thing. Maybe to French ears it sounds like Dylan, and the singer obviously is trying really hard to pull it off, but it just made me extremely angry.<|SEP|><|SEP|>It's not even a copycat singer singing a Dylan song - it's a fake Dylan singing a song he made up to sound like a Dylan song. How dare he? and how dare they give him an international venue for his plagiarism? If they want a Dylan song, dig up the cash and use a real one, not a cheap fake. I'm still angry about that.<|SEP|><|SEP|>So I recommend this movie ONLY for Rahim's fantastic performance. I'm going to watch whatever other movies with him are available and hope they have something to offer in addition to him, because great acting in mediocre movies only goes so far."

If Darth Vader had a pencil sharpener, this would be it. I am not sure if there have been any strides made over the centuries, or even the last few years, in the actual sharpness of a pencil. No one as far as I know has stated that they would not have written the same masterpiece if their pencil had not been as sharp as it was after using blah blah blah. But modern technology has allowed some pretty mind boggling advances in how sophisticated the actual sharpening device can be.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The Stanley Bostitch EPS14HC seems to have covered every single base other than having a small internal camera and external LCD screen to display the tip of your pencil actually being sharpened as you do it. The case is very attractive, and it does boast some real world features that are both thoughtful and handy. These include rubber suction feet to keep the sharpener from moving around while you use it, a rotating guide that allows pencils of various diameters to be smoothly and accurately inserted -- got to have pencil insertion accuracy, a sensor that stops the sharpening when the pencil has reached a fine tip, no over sharpening, removable cutting blades that can be switched out if and when the pencil sharpener starts to falter after the millionth pencil, anti microbial coatings to help protect you from your less hygienic work mates, a nifty blue light, and a very handy and large front removable shavings drawer.<|SEP|><|SEP|>I don't know if my own scribblings will ever live up to the potential of the Stanley Bostitch EPS14HC, but I am ready to find any excuse I can now to use a pencil. Seriously, this is a great pencil sharpener, I can't really imagine how anyone could improve on the ideas and design of this unit. For me it's definitely a keeper. RECOMMENDED."

This system works and works well and is completely reliable, fast - everything you're looking for. Don't even worry about any complexity of setup - this is just super easy to set up and it really works. The package I got from Amazon was just a bubble wrap with the item, a short coax cable, a two-way 2Ghz splitter and a quick start guide. If you want to plug it in as is and go it works fine. If you want to add encryption or pick a particular frequency to use, you need a setup utility that you have to download online. I just Googled the brand and model number on the device and downloaded the setup utility with ease. The utility is straight forward and obvious to use - you pick a frequency (I just picked SCAN) and if you want, encrypt your home signals with a numerical password. That's all the utility does. Not all home setups have the right kind of 2GHZ splitters throughout the house, so scan will pick a frequency for you your home wiring can handle. If you want top speed, replace all your splitters with the 2GHz type and pick the highest frequency in the setup utility. Can't say enough praise for this tech. No worries. This is the one to buy."

14532,__label2__,5,Y,Lawn and Garden,B0030BG1L8,GreenWorks 26032 12 Amp 20-Inch Corded Snow Thrower,Nice little Snowblower..so far.,"I live in Northern Wisconsin and have wanted a snow blower for years, it was just never in the budget or I figured it would be lazy of me instead of shoveling! Well, now that I'm getting a little older and time seems to be lacking, I decided to finally get a small and inexpensive snow blower, I eventually narrowed my research down to this unit. I actually ordered this in anticipation of an impending snow and ice storm. I wanted one that I could use for clearing our front and rear decks and also to clear a path to our satellite dish and to our propane tank and generator area, I also wanted to use it on our roof. So with the light weight of this little snow blower, I thought this would be perfect not to mention the price is great!<|SEP|><|SEP|>I was able to assemble it with very little time and effort and was able to try it out the next morning. With it being Mid December, we have about 5-6 inches of soft but coarse snow and another 2-3 inches of hard packed snow on top of that and there's also about two inches of ice on top of that. So as you can imagine, I put this snow blower to the test right away. I was very pleased to find that it wasn't very loud at all, I would say it's about the same as our vacuum cleaner, maybe even a little quieter. I got going on our front deck and was happy to see that the snow was being thrown well into the yard and away from the deck, I would say about 20-25 feet! I will say that due to the light weight of the unit, it did take a little muscle to push the snow blower into the hard packed snow and ice in some spots. I quickly learned that if you let the blade chew or ease it's way into the snow, you can make some pretty good progress. The motor was more than adequate for the snow, packed snow and ice combination that I was clearing from my deck. After reading some reviews that said that they had problems with the snow chute, to my surprise, the chute was fairly easy to adjust and the snow blower made quick work of a task that would usuallytake about a half hour. It probably cleared the deck in about half the time it would take with a shovel, but the best part was that it only took about 1/4 of the effort! Soon, I was clearing a spot where our garbage cans sit and then I was off to make a path to our satellite, which seems to get clogged up with snow ALL of the time. Next, I was clearing a path to our propane tank and then to the shelter that holds our portable generator. I was pleased that this usually tiresome and daunting task was already done, all with minimal effort.<|SEP|><|SEP|>One thing I did learn almost immediately is that you better make sure everything is cleared from your path. This snow blower will chew up and spit up anything in it's path!! My son is minus a few less toy plastic trucks that I didn't see under the snow and all of them were chewed up and shot about 20 feet away!! I have yet to finish clearing the back deck and will then be moving on up to the roof to clear it off also. I hope this review helps someone, because at this point I can say so far, so good!"

13479,__label2__,5,N,Video DVD,B004I8WN14,Rosario + Vampire: CAPU2 (Season 2),Good follow up,"Tsukune failed his entrance exam. Luckily he was able to get into 1 school. He finds out that it is a school for youkai (monsters). On the way to his new school he meets a vampire girl named Moka. She's very self conscious from living in the human world through middle school. She quickly begins to cling to Tsukune. He also manages to attract a succubus named Kurumu, a snow woman named Mizore, and a little witch named Yukari. All 3 of these cute girls are all about him and fight like crazy people to win his affection. The problem he faces is his humanity. If he is discovered to be human he will be killed. The only other person that knows is Moka, but Moka is loving and loyal enough to keep his secret.<|SEP|><|SEP|>This season begins with all the characters going back for 2nd year. This time Tsukune meets Moka's sister, Kokoa, on his way to school. She's a feisty brat, and she's determined to remove Moka's seal and get her ""real"" sister back. There are also 2 episodes that involve Kurumu and Mizore's mothers. There just older versions of their daughters.<|SEP|><|SEP|>There is a descent amount of nudity in this season, unlike the 1st. So it's probably more of an R rating. There is not much of a difference as far as the animation and flow of the series is concerned. Thankfully, all of the voice actors have returned. I think they do a good job. I have seen rumors of a 3rd season, and I hope they are true. At the end of this season Moka tells Tsukune that he will be having to choose one of the girls very soon. That leads me to believe that a 3rd is likely. The popularity of this anime in Japan is also very large.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Overall this is a great harem anime with cool characters and lots of laughs. I really enjoyed it and I hope you do too!"

Coffee Beans are to be enjoyed when they are fresh roasted. They are a perishable product that can go stale. I have been subscribing to this product, and have often being sent older stored roasted date beans. Fresh roasted coffee beans reach their ""peak"" at about 2 weeks after roasting, and diminish from there. My last shipment was 3 month old beans under my 'Subscribe and Save'. The original beans are quite good, but no longer being 'fresh roasted' by the time I receive them was disappointing I had to discontinue the Subscribe and Save as a result of this... How to read a Coffee Bean Direct Date Code at the bottom of 5lb bag: First off, the ""Expiration Date"" is exactly 1 year from the Roast/Packing Date. Second, the date code is written as such: (example) ""26714.02 "" EQUALS ""267""th day of year (20)""14"" . batch ""02"". 267th day of year is Sept 24th; 14 is year 2014; .02 is 2nd batch of day.... Being sent 3 month old beans is the fault of warehouse inventory control. I believe the vendor does freshly pack his beans, and sends to Amazon warehouse. Then Amazon stockpiles it into warehouse storage, and ships out older stockpiles... I really want freshest roast date product, so I have to again change vendor sources... **** Original Review*** I have been using Malabar Monsooned beans for about 8 Years, and I am glad to have this new source to choose from. I feel that monsooned malabar is optimal for Cappuccinos, as its smoothness complements micro-foamed milk quite well. My first pull from this new order had a very nice crema, dark golden colored as hoped for and expected. Smooth and rich. City Roasted, roasted till the first crack and allowed to rest before finishing, had the characteristics I wanted, not too darkly roasted... So for people who want to grind their beans via a burr grinder, and pull a golden shot via their dialed in espresso machine, I can recommend this. I don't use this for drip coffee, so I can't comment on that, but this makes a pretty good cappuccino via my Gaggia Classic. 4.25 Stars"

10592,__label2__,4,N,Office Products,B00P9SI8IE,iGearPro Multifunctional Voice Recorder - Portable Rechargeable Digital Audio Dictaphone - MP3 Player (8GB),More Useful as an MP3 Player than a WAV Recorder,"I received a free item to review. The interface is a little quirky; the multi-use buttons could have been better thought out: The mode/select button is used a lot and I think would function better as a large round button on the front rather than the small push switch on the side - it would also be more comfortable for both right and left-handed users. The sliding power side switch lies too flush with the case and the texture doesn’t make for an easy grip – you have to really press and push to move it. I also don’t like that I can’t select Play directly after adjusting the volume. I have to select Stop first – that’s just bad design. Selecting and deleting files is not as intuitive as I’d like, but the unit was recognized by Windows 7 easily and the folders can be accessed directly. While the WAV file bit rate isn’t adequate for serious music recording, the recorder works fine as a scratch pad for saving instrumental or vocal ideas. Frankly it’s neither as full-featured nor useful as my Zoom H2 recorder but they’re at different price points and it’s not really fair to compare. The MP3 Player mode comes with two “C-Pop” recordings of what sound like male and female Chinese vocalists singing English phonetically. The unit’s built-in speaker is not so useful, but the buds sound quite good. Of the seven EQ presets only 3-4 were noticeably distinct to my ears, including the Dynamic Bass Boost. Overall it makes a compact little mp3 player with decent sound. But a better design and better recording capability would make it more competitive with other products in this range."

The long neck allows the light to be in the full sun just about all day.<|SEP|><|SEP|>This light comes without any instructions. The only thing you need to know is that the light should be turned on once by pushing a switch in a small hole on the light side (see video). I used a sewing needle to do it, but a paper clip or any other thin thing will work. The light is quite bright. I am attaching several shots of the light over the door of our barn during the day and during the night, you can see that it lights a fairly large area pretty well.<|SEP|><|SEP|>One of the immediately noticeable things about this particular solar light was the fact that it would extend out away from a building rather than stay flush against it.

I do have another LEAGY solar light and the brilliant LED lights are ultra-bright as stated. All of the hardware is included in the package.

The orange color is a benefit, because if it does go overboard, or if you leave it on the shore, you can easily spot it from a distance. So far, we've not had the opportunity to set it in the water and leave it for several hours to test just *how* waterproof it is, but it has held up in regular use and in rainy conditions.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Perfect bag for kayaking and other water-based sports."

13849,__label2__,5,N,Camera,B00AWZFHG0,Canon VIXIA HF G20 HD Camcorder with HD CMOS Pro and 32GB Internal Flash Memory,"Old school, but the footage quality speaks for itself","I got this camera to shoot vacation footage on a 20 day road trip from Edinburgh to London. For a home use camcorder the image quality is jaw dropping. People comment they're watching a HD broadcast of a travel show when they see my footage. For me its clinchers were the traditional viewfinder, indoor/low lighting quality (which is excellent) and the extra memory slots. I find its flip-out panel viewfinder handy at times but generally a PITA when you have 55 year old eyes without reading glasses handy. My only complaints are that the G20 is rather bulky, the 60i recording of very fast moving objects results in a somewhat jumpy/strobe like appearing motion on the footage, and its touch screen and menu system are clumsy for me to use. Though this camera is pricey, it is no more expensive adjusted for inflation than the flagship Sony HC90 Camcorder I bought in 2006 (and to think I was once impressed by it). For 20+ years that I've been shooting home video footage (this is the fourth camcorder I've used) one thing has remained a constant: extra batteries are an absolute must! I use Adobe Premiere Elements and Sony DVD Architect Studio to create full HD bluray discs from the G20 footage. With PE I customize its h.264 encoder to use all the highest quality compression settings, for its encoding presets are a little lacking quality-wise and are geared towards better compute performance for mid to lower end CPUs. With these enhanced h.264 settings the generated footage looks as good as the source recording. I bet quality home use camcorders will soon go the way of the quality point and shoot cameras; cellphones and action cams are taking over these markets. My niece laughs at my G20 and finds it funny that I'm not embarrassed to use it in public (though my kids know better)."

When a property is vacant, I take care<|SEP|><|SEP|>of the lawn. I have a corded mower, but I am tired of maintaining the cord.<|SEP|><|SEP|>One time, I accidentally cut the cord while mowing. I have been thinking of getting a cordless mower, but that model has a heavy non-removable battery and the whole mower is way too heavy from transportation point of view.<|SEP|><|SEP|>I am so happy to get this cordless mower with removable battery. I already have following 36-V cordless tools from B&D: cordless line trimmer, cordless blower, and cordless hedge trimmer. To my surprise, this cordless mower from B&H can take either 40V or 36V batteries. So, I have totally 5 batteries available for running this cordless mower.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Majority of the construction material of this mower is thick plastic. With that, I would say the whole mower is a little on the flimsy side. However, that's good to me, as the mower is very light, not only from operation point of view, but also from transportation point of view. Even better yet, the whole handle bar can be easily collapsed down to take minimum space for both storage and transportation in my car.<|SEP|><|SEP|>This mower is very quite, just like a fan running on high settings. The rear grass collecting bag is small but it is easy to remove and put back on. The light weight of this mower makes it easy to move around at tight corners.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Some points need to be aware before choosing this cordless mower.<|SEP|><|SEP|>One: each battery lasts about 15 minutes.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Two: when a battery is fully drained, it usually is too hot to be charged. The charger will notify you on this and it won't start charging till the battery (inside) has cooled down. And each battery takes about one hour to be fully recharged. So, be expecting about 90-minute time for a fully drained battery to be available again.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Three: It has limited power. When the grass is either too tall, or too dense, the motor will slow down.When the amount of grass is beyond its capability, the motor simply stops. Then, you have to release the button, wait for a minute and then re-start again. On the good side, it means there is no way you can burn the motor. On the negative side, it slows down your mowing work.<|SEP|><|SEP|>All in all, as long as you are aware about the limitations of this cordless mower, I think it is a very good choice for properties with small lawns. I would definite recommend it to my friends."

I was an early adopter of DVR. Tivo I thought was an amazing product. I was totally satisfied with my Tivo on Direct TV although I was not able to take advantage of updated software since my box was so old. We finally got a new TV in 2011 (HD) and I needed to upgrade receivers. Of course Direct TV didn't really offer a Tivo option so I was forced to use their DVRs only to find that they were far inferior to Tivo. Lived with it for 1.5 years and decided that we wanted to cut-the-cord and ditch cable. I tested several options (Roku, Apple TV, opensource DVR) and found that Tivo was far superior in technology and functionality. So we decided to move forward with Tivo. The only issue with my Tivo is that fact that I can't take advantage of my Amazon Prime Instant Video. I felt that this was mis-advertised - there was no disclaimer that I saw. Even though its not a deal-breaker, I think it is important for Tivo to develop this capability/licensing."

8142,__label1__,5,N,Camera,B00KGEMKHG,Foscam FHC994 Megapixel HD 1280 x 720p H.264 Mini Video Camera and DVR (Black),Better than similar product,What a neat mini video camera. It was an easy set up. I charged the device for 8 hours and afterwards I glanced over the first few paragraphs of the updated user instructions. This item does not require batteries. It has an internal battery. I purchased a MICRO SDHC memory card for storage as needed and a 8 GB was only twelve dollars at Walgreens. It was so simple: Charge device using the charger provided and insert the memory card and press the on button. You also have a choice of three video recording modes. When the video camera is working correctly you will see a blinking green light. Don't be surprised if you are already recording while learning to use the camera. This happened to me. Next I wanted to figure out how to play back a video. Wow it took me under five minutes to figure out how. First plug the video camera into your computer by using the USB cord provided. Now go to the start menu and click on Your Computer. Look for the correct drive where your camera is located. Now if you are in the right place it will have a file that opens and says DVR. Doubled click on the DVR and you will see instant video with playback options. I couldn't believe how beautifully clear the picture was! The Megapixels in HD are awesome in the video recordings. I am impressed. The size is very compact. This will definitely come in handy!

I am dismayed and shocked that the paper work explicitly states several times that the warranty is invalid if the product is not registered within 10 days of purchase. This seems like some sort of scam that Nikon is using to weasel out of honoring the offered warranty.

So be warned, if the extended warranty is important to you, make sure you register as soon as you receive the lens.<|SEP|><|SEP|>UPDATE--to Nikon's credit, I received a prompt reply to my email questioning whether they would honor the extended warranty--message follows--<|SEP|><|SEP|>""Thank you for contacting Nikon. I do apologize for any inconvenience. Our Nikkor lenses comes with an additional 4 year warranty. In order to receive the additional 4 year warranty, you must register the lens as well as maintain the proof of purchase if any issues occur with the lens. Since it was a gift, if any issues occur and you need to send your camera to our service center, we recommend you state that in a brief description.""<|SEP|><|SEP|>no mention of the 10 day requirement here so why put it in the official paperwork?

We tried moistening the cups with water, they held about 10 seconds. We tried the last resort, isopropyl alcohol and had similar results to water. The whole idea is shot when the suction cups don't work. The shade is well-made and folds up nicely. Update on 1/27/2015: Great Customer Service! The company informed me that I might have received an older pair of shades and will re-send a new pair to me. I will update it after testing the new pair. Update on 1/30/2015: Sellers were very good to help us get a screen that works for us. We now have a working screen and believe the suction cup problem is due to the suction cups being folded over in the package during shipping. We're all set, thanks to the sellers help."

It is 1 ¼"" wide and 5"" long. I already have one of these small ones that are more difficult to read as I get older. The write-up on this BBQ thermometer gave the impression that it was larger. The product description said that it would be 10"" long. This is false advertising by Amazon, and one reason that I hate to buy things from a catalog. If it is broken or not as advertised, you have to go through the headache of returning it through the mail. At least if you buy something in an old style brick and mortar store, you can go there and return it more easily. In the same shipment, I also received from Amazon a broken Salter kitchen scale that was made of cheap plastic with chrome paint. The description of that item gave the impression that it was chrome covered metal, not plastic. More false or misleading advertising by Amazon. I give up. I will shop at a local kitchen store instead, where I can see what I am getting, and can evaluate the product in the store. Fortunately, I can still drive a car and I do not have to depend on catalogs. The one good thing that I can say about this product, is that it gave exactly the same temperature reading as the one I already had.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Farberware Products, c/o Lifetime Brands, Inc., Customer Service Department, P.O.

So, I decided to purchase one that was small to keep from wasting too much money on a camera that would not produce. After all, most of the rave reviews are given to very large and expensive cameras. It was time to see if a mini camera could produce what it promised, and I felt like I had nothing to lose.<|SEP|><|SEP|>This pocket camera proved to be an excellent choice. It has excellent shutter speed, very fast recovery in between shots, 10x zoom capability, low light capability, macro capibility, and nice video quality. In other words, it does exactly what you'd expect a ""point-and-shoot"" camera to do: take great pictures.<|SEP|><|SEP|>However, it doesn't work well with the flash, and it has a very dark quality when recording video in low light. If you can handle using small flush buttons and going through multiple menu items to erase a picture or toggle between manual and automatic pictures, then it's worth your while. After all, anyone wanting a compact camera is not asking for professional photography. You just want something that's easy to carry that will also take good pictures. This camera hits the mark."

The cover in the back has elastic in it but it arrived stretched out so there was no way to tighten it to make it fit properly.

The reviews were quite good and said they would be able to do the same as the Hue for 1/10 the price, I must admit I was a bit skeptical but figured for the price I could give them a try (and at worse purchase the Hue if they broke).<|SEP|>I can say the colors are very bright. The controller is simple and easy to use to change colors. They are great for party or evening dinner to dim the light or change the setting. The one thing I may say- the white light in these bulbs is a bit blue in color, so you may need to keep your normal white lights.<|SEP|>But for money, I am very happy w/ my buy- they do everything that is described. I have had these for 3 months now and still no problems. Thank you Torchstar!!!!<|SEP|>Many people reviewing mentioned articles in the New York Times and USA Today, so I decided to use google to take a look. My cousin had purchased similar bulbs and they were very cool. They changed the mood of karaoke party. For the price, I decided to try them and figure at worse I had wasted $20 to try a smart bulb. I have used these for 2 months and can share the following:<|SEP|>The bulb colors are very bright, particularly the blue color makes a cool mood. When turning off the bulb, it remembers the previous color setting, very smart. The remote is easy to use and all the functions work properly (considering the price I wasn't sure). My favorite feature is mixing colors- always love playing with it to create a new mood. The only thing I may say is these bulbs are more of a toy than a regular light."

The first was a 1st Gen Wave that I broke the pliers, the second was a 2nd Gen Wave that was stolen while in the field, and now the Surge. To me the 1st Gen Wave is where its at. The small flathead was the PERFECT size and new one breaks very easily. The new scissors also does not cut as well and sometimes jams up on the pliers when closing. Leatherman needs to bring back the 1st Gen Wave.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Anyhow, the Surge is beefier in the hand but still fits in a 9mm mag pouch (how I carry it on my MOLLE chest rig). The only noticable difference other than the size is that the outer file has been replaced with a beefier scissors that actually cuts instead of bending material. The inner flathead is wider, the soon-to-be-broken small flathead is still there, and there is a small scraping blade (at least that's what I think it might be).<|SEP|><|SEP|>One of the things I miss most about my 1st Gen Wave is that with minimal break-in I could open it like a butterfly knife with one hand. Have some gun oil ready upon opening. All said, I would highly recommend this tool over the 2nd Gen Wave (but not the 1st Gen Wave).<|SEP|><|SEP|>UPDATE: Upon removing the sheath from the packaging I noticed a small, thin plastic sheath containing a file blade that can be swapped out with the saw blade.

The old one is very scratched due to a hard life. I love the new watch as it has hands which contrast with the white face (this was a problem with the old watch). The new one is a bit thicker than the old (by .050) but it has buttons which are larger and easier to press and the face is larger. The thing that is most important to me is that it is fairly thin (.407&#34;). Most watches these days stand tall on the wrist making them difficult to access wearing a long sleeved shirt.
282,__label1__,4,N,Books,006114844X,And Only to Deceive (Lady Emily),"Romantic, elegant mystery","The premise of And Only to Deceive excited me enough to get a copy the very same day I first heard about it. The idea of a reverse love story, a woman falling in love with the man she married only after his death, married with the mystery/suspense, as well as the Victorian setting appealed to me very much.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Alexander portrayed the romantic part of the romantic suspense in an elegant and intelligent manner. Through reading his journals, Emily is astounded to discover that the ordinary aristocrat she thought she had married harbored passionate love for her and was far more interesting than she knew. This made me question Emily's intelligence and powers of observation, though. Was she so self-absorbed that she didn't take the time to get to know the man she was going to spend the rest of her life with? The more she finds out about Phillip, the more regret grows until Emily falls in love with her dead husband and begins to truly mourn him. Rather than letting her heroine lionize Philip, without question, Alexander then begins to poke holes in his character and Emily's idolatry of him. In keeping with Emily's newfound interest in Greek antiquities and Greek literature, there is a long-running discourse throughout the book regarding who is the better hero, Achilles or Hector. Alexander uses this discourse in subtle comparison to Emily's love for her dead husband - the man she never knew and built up in her mind as an incomparable demi-god (like Achilles) with her flawed (but alive) suitors (like Hector, a human who dares battle Achilles, protected by the gods, to protect his kingdom).<|SEP|><|SEP|>I liked Alexander's exploration of Emily's liminal role in Victorian society as a widow, neither mother or wife or virgin bride-to-be. She comes to the realization that without a husband, yet with his fortune, she is basically a free woman, able to do as she pleases within or even out of society.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Emily's character, however, made no emotional connection with me. Other than being very beautiful, so much so that her dead husband's secret nickname for her was Kallista (the most beautiful) and being an avid reader, she was not very interesting. I could not see why sophisticated Philip fell in love with her; however, Alexander shows that perhaps, like Emily falling in love with the dead Philip, Philip also fell in love with a figment of his own romantic imagination. He didn't know her, but chose her for her beauty, as Paris chose Helen for hers.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Emily develops, however, throughout the course of the story. Initially inspired by her husband's interests, she develops interests of her own: Greek antiquities, learning ancient Greek, the epic poems. She also explores her newfound freedom as an independent woman of means.<|SEP|><|SEP|>""Dissatisfied, I put down the book, irritated that Philip was not there. I desperately wanted the chance to argue about these things with him. As I sat there, I slowly began to realize that my own opinions were quite different from those of my husband. Until then I had attributed all my interest in classical antiquity to Phillip and had assumed that his own studies would serve as an adequate guide for mine. I no longer felt driven to study as a way to know Phillip. I wanted to study because I loved the poetry, because the beauty of Greek sculpture moved me...""<|SEP|><|SEP|>The suspense part of the novel was lackluster and slow-moving. While I liked the discussion of Greek antiquities and details of the Impressionist art movement, I was never gripped with the fervent need to get to the bottom of whodonit. The sequels sound like they're set in some amazing locales; however, I don't believe I will be continuing this series."

Amazon was good enough to send me another one. Alas, this one has issues too. The whammy bar is a bit wobbly, and it can easily be activated even when it is not desired. I know this because the last one had a whammy bar you could set perpendicular to the device, and it would not activate at all.

11452,__label2__,4,N,Video DVD,B002KLQ2Y0,Franklyn [Blu-ray],"If you believe in something strongly enough, who's to say if it's real or not?","Revolving around four lost souls and set in two parallel worlds, Franklyn certainly isn't the Dark City/superhero movie it was rather misleadingly sold as but a rather more ambitious variation on that old arthouse favourite, the apparent strangers who are gradually drawn to the same place and event that will impact differently on each of their lives. There's probably no more to it than meets the eye, but Gerald McMorrow moves and shoots his pieces so well that it's surprisingly satisfying to see them come together. If anything, despite its impressively designed if sparingly used fantasy scenes, the film is probably more influenced by Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire with its hints of people, possibly real, possibly not, who come into your life at the right time and then fade away.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Eva Green is a troubled performance artist whose art project is built around filming her meticulously planned suicide attempts; Bernard Hill a church warden searching London for his missing son; Sam Riley an incurable romantic just jilted at the altar yet again and searching for his childhood sweetheart; and Ryan Philippe a masked atheist in a city of religious fanatics seeking revenge on the cult leader who killed a girl he was hired to protect. Gradually stories and actors (though not their roles) start to overlap, fantasies punctured and old wounds reopened or cauterised. Think about it too much and you'll probably be way ahead of the filmmakers, but go with the film at its own pace and it's surprisingly rewarding. McMurrow has a real visual sense that too few British filmmakers have: it's not just empty style or good looking shots for the sake of being good looking but in service of the story, characters and ideas. Those ideas may not be particularly deep or profound - ultimately little more than the need to acknowledge reality, however painful, rather than hiding in fantasy before you can move on - but they're delivered with sincerity and imagination and, with the partial exception of Riley's rather typically milquetoast turn, convincingly played.<|SEP|><|SEP|>It'd be stretching it to say that Franklyn is a great film, but it is a great and encouraging directorial debut. It'll be interesting to see what McMorrow comes up with next.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The Blu Ray has a decent selection of extras for a film that made so little impression at the box-office, including making of featurette and deleted scenes but not, sadly, McMorrow's 2002 short Thespian X which inspired the film."

16824,__label2__,4,Y,Home Entertainment,B00T48CVVK,Samsung UN55JU7100 55-Inch 4K Ultra HD 3D Smart LED TV,Really great TV so far,"First, I'd like to say don't pay attention to any review that isn't a verified purchase. More than likely they're reviewing an incorrect TV or just bad mouthing Samsung. I was checking daily for this TV to show up on Amazon. I did so because I was holding out for the new Samsung TV line to come out. I bought this set on 3/6/15, the day it came out. There was immediately a review shortly thereafter from someone which I knew it was complete BS. That review claimed that the TV arrived with dust on it and spelled &#34;welcome&#34; incorrectly and all these problems of clouding blah blah blah. It wasn't true in the least. I'm telling ya, don't consider any review that isn't a verified purchase. This TV is really great so far. I got this specific model because it was literally the only new Samsung TV that wasn't curved. I wasn't sold on curved after doing a ton of reviewing about it and checking it out in the store. Purchased on 3/6 and it got here about 3/10.. The packing was really well. You'll need basic tools to put the cable detangler/stand on. I was able to do it myself. Unlike the other reviews, I had no problem connecting to Wifi. I did start wireless at first no problems, but now have it connected to an Apple Airport Extreme that I use as an accesspoint to hardwire both my TV and my PS4(for the purpose of faster download/upload speed of course). My TV did update immediately upon purchase and I found it updating within the first couple of days often (probably due to new release, getting bugs out) The video is great. I haven't tested 4k via netflix or the sort yet, but have been playing games on the PS4 and streaming video from my Apple Macbook Pro over to the Panasonic. What I wasn't a fan of at first, but now like is the One Connect Mini. The TV is otherwise naked as far as connecting ports without it(no hdmi on the TV directly itself). I have come to like it because one of the problems I've had in my other TVs is that the HDMI cable had a hardtime staying connected into the port when it was horizontally hanging from the middle/upper corner of the TV. The cable would eventually just get loose, droop downward giving it a weak connection. The one connect mini fixes that, but it still seems odd the TV doesn't have at least ONE HDMI port directly on it, in case ya know, something happens to the One Connect Mini. This is why it doesn't get 5 stars. You shouldn't need box that is like an accessory for a TV. Also I noticed that the One Connect Mini isn't universal among all points. Like I can't plug my PS4 or computer into one of the ports at one side etc. I am about to pick up a Roku 3 or Apple TV to stream video over wirelessly. The remote is pretty cool and accessing the menu options etc is a piece of cake. The remote is motion sensitive and is your primary way of guiding through the TV(though the power button the back will allow you to toggle through as well). I have this in my room and doesn't experience any clouding. Granted in the sun, I can see reflections such as blinds etc, but overall I really am happy with the purchase."

18645,__label2__,5,Y,Baby,B00295MQLU,"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, X-Small-Large",A must-have for any working and pumping mom!,"This hands-free breastpump bra, is hands down (or up, or really wherever you want them!) the best investment you can make for your pumping efforts -- besides a quality pump, of course. Thus far, I have only been using this bra at home (I go back to work later this week), but I have managed to pump nearly 70 ounces using this bra, and I can't imagine doing it any other way. It makes pumping such a breeze, and frees my hands up to do other things (or even just relax). In fact, I'm wearing it and pumping RIGHT NOW, as I type this review at 80 wpm!<|SEP|><|SEP|>I use the Ameda Purely Yours, and the flanges fit and hold perfectly. I can't imagine a flange for any pump that wouldn't work. The bra holds the flanges snug and securely against my breast, without being constricting or uncomfortable at all. It feels like I'm just wearing my favorite sports bra. The fabric is very soft and would be comfortable to wear all day, if you wish (and you can add straps to it, to facilitate this). I find it easy enough to throw on over my bra, with the nursing flaps folded down, whenever I'm ready to pump.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Sizing the bra was easy. I bought the XS/S/M size. I typically wear size Medium or size 10 tops. My bust is a 36D. There's a Velcro panel on the back that you can adjust as much or as little as you need. I have mine attached about an inch from each edge of the piece. There is also an extender piece that zips on/off in the front, allowing you to make it a little bigger, and also to adjust where the holes are so they line up with where your nipples are. I do not need to use that extender piece. With my sizing, I'd say I'm at the upper end of the size range for the XS/S/M size. Regardless, it fits perfectly and comfortably, and I don't see any reason why I'd need to size up.<|SEP|><|SEP|>I've been using it for 2.5 months now, and it still looks brand new. The quality and construction are great, and I see no reason it won't last me a long time.<|SEP|><|SEP|>I really can't imagine pumping without it. The only time I've ever not used it was when I've used a manual pump, but it's such a drag having to hold the pump against your breast -- I can't imagine trying to double pump without it (and having to hold the flanges onto your breasts with one or both hands -- certainly not relaxing!). It's nice to have your hands free to read a book, fiddle with the switches on the pump, continue doing your work, or even to do breast compressions if you need a little extra help with pumping. And since being relaxed is key to pumping well, this bra makes that so much easier, making it truly a must have!"

But, this thing is REALLY handy. The oversimplified product description doesn't do it justice. First of all, the outer &#34;wings&#34; are weighted (more on this in a minute) and very comfy in both directions - a nice feature when cranking a head down tight to seat it. Second, when you remove the lanyard to use it, there is a knurled knob-like part that sticks up above the key. Once tension rods are loose (either during removal or installation), you can give it a spin between your fingers and make fast work of the rod (the weighted wings give it a little inertia to keep it spinning). Third, the little colored rubber nubs (supplied) are handy in TWO ways: a) by using different colors it can assist in keeping track of revolutions, and b) they're perfect for tapping near the edge for lug tuning. The lanyard is an added bonus for keeping track of the key, either around your neck or hanging off one of the floor tom tension rods. I'd recommend it, and may even buy a second one for my practice kit."

It is fast-paced, the author has a personal stake in this story, which is really two stories, and the author's enjoyment and enthusiasm comes through when he pieces together his well-researched clues to tell the tale of his disappearing great-uncle and the history of his great-uncle's employer, the L.R.

I love how easy it is that I can set up the baby monitor. I didn't have to mess around with wi-fi or Bluetooth settings to get the monitor connected to my iPhone. Just paired my phone and the moitor with USB cable, and that's it. One of the best things I like about the unit is that I don't have to leave the app view on all the time at night, it will send me an alert when my baby is awake. It is a really useful feature. And the cherry on top, is that whenever the alert is sent to me, I also get a few pictures of my baby, so I know if my baby is really awake or it is just a false alarm.<|SEP|>However, just like any other baby monitors out there, this one is not without flaw.

Great Build and Looks...,"These will not compare to a pair of $300 plus Sennheisers or DRE Sennheisers http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B008BXB76Y DRE Phones http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00E9262IE As far as THESE headphones. They are a great set of headphones overall and will not disappoint you. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00UN5Z1BK Cons - My biggest con with this headphone is - not only I can hear the music but also everyone sitting around me, even if they are at a distance of 15 feet. There are no sound proof systems with this headphone and thus there is lot of leakage in the audio. So it seriously becomes a speaker instead of a headphone at volumes just at two bars. Pros + Looks sturdy, although it is made of plastic. It fits well for someone with a smaller head as it fits really tight so that it doesn't slip from your head (happens when you are doing a workout or so enthusiastically shaking your head for your favorite song). Prolonged usage caused a little soreness over the ears. The head band is adjustable. + Easily pairs up with any device. I was able to pair it with both my computer (mac air) and my iphone. Once pairing is done with all the devices, you can connect to two of them simultaneously. Although, there were certain issues when I was in a microsoft lync meeting. The microphone was connected in mono mode and hence people hear muffled voices from me. + Most important - the sound quality. The first impression was not great and I decided to actually return the product. But, I experimented with more good quality audio with deep bass, techno, melody, etc... The SOUND IS NOT THAT GREAT. Don't expect bass from this headphone. But it is decent enough with the sound quality that you won't repent your purchase. + Volume - This is seriously loud even with the lowest volume level in your device as well as the headphones. BASS very low. + Functionality with phone - It works well both with the mic and the sound. Problem occurs only when you are connected in mono mode andnot stereo mode (I use this terminology as shown in my mac air for this headphone). While in mono mode, people hear your muffled voice and you hear back nothing. If you are connecting to more than two devices and one of them is your phone, connect to your phone first and then to the other device next. + Charge - This headphone retains pretty good charge. Its been 4 days since I charged it and I use it at least for 3 hrs everyday. The iphone also shows how much charge is left on the headphones. Overall, this is a good headphone if you are not looking for something too good for music listening.

He told me it would not produce a lot of messy dust in the copier/printer as other papers do. I have been using it ever since. I have always liked the 5-ream pack-see GP Copy & Print Paper, 8.5 x 11 Inches Letter Size, 92 Bright White, 20 Lb, 5 Reams/Carton (2500 Sheets). It's convenient, but was not available this time with &#34;&#34;Amazon Prime&#34;&#34; shipping. In fact, the price was much higher (not being sold by Amazon). So, I saw these 3-ream cartons with &#34;&#34;Prime.&#34;&#34; Like the 5-ream, these are easy to carry, compared to the bigger boxes of ten reams. I have always found the price to be one of the best bargains. It looks like Amazon is going to keep it like that. One of my main complaints about having paper like this delivered is that they so often come &#34;&#34;beat-up!&#34;&#34; Then, you have to go through the whole process of returning it. What a pain! I think we all hate that! Right? What's the use? Not this time! These came from the manufacturer in a thicker than normal cardboard box which seemed to resist shipping damage. Hopefully, this is where I will buy all my paper in the future.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Update: 4/5/2014 -- Almost a year later, this is where I have bought most of my paper since. I am extremely satisfied with this paper, the size of the box, the convenience, the packing (if you buy more than one box), basically everything! And, in all this time I have not had a &#34;&#34;beat-up&#34;&#34; box of paper delivered.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Update: 8/27/2014 -- I have tried other deals on the 10-Ream Cartons GP Spectrum Premium Multi Use Paper, 8.5 x 11 Inches Letter Size, 92 Bright White, 10 Reams/Carton (5000 Sheets) that occasionally appear, but each time the office staff has asked that we go back to using this economical, very convenient and easy to handle 3-Ream Pack.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Update: 2/18/2015 -- I tried GP Spectrum® 96 Multipurpose Paper at a good price.

It is the first SLR i've ever owned, and although it took a little practice and reading the manual (as with any new technology you buy) it was relatively easy to learn how to operate. Keep your manual handy if you're just starting out. I probably would not suggest the D5000 for someone who hasn't had ANY SLR experience before. It can be intimidating at first, so I might suggest a more user-friendly or beginners version of a Nikon SLR. After learning how to use this camera, i absolutely love it, it is my baby. At first I had some trouble with grainy images, but learning the proper ISO settings changes everything. There isn't really anything I can think of (or have tried) that this camera can't do.

All those lenses have produced great pictures, especially when using RAW output corrected for distortion and chromatic aberrations through software such as Adobe Camera Raw and Lightroom. When using the JPG mode the more recent NEX cameras, such as the NEX-5N and NEX-7, will, if the firmware has been updated, make a lot of those same corrections internally and automatically apply the corrections to the saved JPG images.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The only draw back to the zoom lenses of course is that they are slow. Still, for low light level work, the use of a so-so slow lens with vibration stabilization will usually beat an optically much better fast lens that does not support stabilization. So I was interested to try the Sony SEL50F18 50mm f/1.8 for low light work. The extra lens speed allows for the use of a lower ISO, and the net gain in image qaulity is worth the cost to use of a fast lens.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The lens has been great for work in low light, and the focal length has been perfect for close-ups of architectural details and art objects. If a photographer shoots in RAW, and uses Adobe Camera RAW or Lightroom to correct for lens distortions via software lens profiles, and to correct for chromatic aberration, or if the photographer shoots in JPG and uses the NEX camera's internal software corrections, then the few weak points of the lens are effectively canceled out. I have been very happy with my Sony SEL50F18 50mm f/1.8, and plan to use it often on my next project. RECOMMENDED."

12112,__label2__,4,Y,Tools,B004DT09WI,"Gerber Bear Grylls Folding Sheath Knife, Serrated Edge [31-000752]",Good value.,"Keeping in mind my EDC folder is a Zero Tolerance 0300, the 4 star rating is based on the $18 and change I paid for this knife here on Amazon. This knife is light, sharp, very comfortable in the hand, easy to find it if you drop it in the woods, has a nice sheath and as with all of the Bear Grylls products comes with the priorities of survival fold out. So for less than $20 you are getting a lot but for the $40 it cost at Cabellas I would leave it on the shelf. However for $18 if I lose or break it, no big loss. The knife is an excellent cutting tool but does not hold an edge extremely well due to the soft steel used in the BG knives (except for the Bear Grylls Ultimate Pro). The soft steel does make re-sharpening a breeze though and this knife being half serrated there is always a usable cutting edge on this knife. There is a nice little pocketc inside the sheath for storing the Priorities of Survival fold out. The blade on this knife locks up very tight though I have not tested its strength nor will I. I don't put too much trust in the locks on my Benchmade, ZT's, SOG's, or Cold Steel knives. Locks can break and I can only assume the cheaper the knife is made the more prone it will be to break so I won't tempt my fate with this one by treating it like a fixed blade, I need all my fingers. All in all it really is quite a nice sheath folder for fishing, day hiking, bug out bag or even a decent EDC knife for those on a tight budget."

So 3 years ago we bought a nice S&F mattress, which had the support, but was too firm on the pressure points. A topper from BBB worked for a couple years, but then it must have worn out and she was getting a lot of pain again. So we tried out a number of different options, including a SN bed, a gel memory foam, this one, and a poly fill topper. The SN bed was a glorified air mattress, which did not help at all and cost as much as our king sized bedroom set. The gel memory foam did not make it out of the package, since the memory foams hadn't worked in the past. The latex was okay at first, but she didn't love it and wanted to try another one. The poly fill topper felt great at first (&#34;like a cloud&#34;), but was compressed by morning and the aches were back. At this point, we gave the latex another shot and after a week, realized that her back pain was gone!<|SEP|><|SEP|>While I'm not picky about what I sleep on, I love the latex too. While the cost is higher than some other options, it has the perfect combination of comfort and support (and is much cheaper than a new bed). Summer is just getting started, but so far it has been as cool as anything else. The quality of this topper is the best I have seen, with a cover that makes it simple to install and rotate. The straps on the cover have no issues fitting over our extra deep mattress. A note on size: it does not extend the full dimensions of the bed, but leaves ~1&#34; all around to help the sheets fit.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Customer service and communication from the seller is top notch.

Ever since I got the QCell, that problem no longer exists. The QCell is small enough to just throw in your backpack, briefcase, purse, etc and know that you are covered. The charge time to get the phone back to a ""worry-free"" level is quite impressive. Those marathon conference calls that seem to occur when you are away from a power source used to be an issue. The long airline flights where you are playing a game on the iPhone, and even though you are in airplane mode, the battery still doesn't last. Well, with the QCell, both those problems is solved. The led comes in handy too when you are in a bind. The laser pointer is nice too, but I don't think I will ever use it.

Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Emma (Natalie Portman) and Adam (Ashton Kutcher) unwillingly keep running into each other - until one day they get really close... Emma however is reluctant to the very idea of a relationship and asks for a &#34;sex only - no strings attached&#34; common operation. Adam, who is much less cynical, agrees after some hesitation (and we can totally understand him - after all, this is Natalie Portman who asks, for God's sake...). Of course, things will not go as smoothly as it is supposed.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The general idea wasn't the easiest thing in the world to be handled, I must give that to the director. But Ivan Reitman, even if he didn't make a really good film since &#34;Ghostbusters&#34; in 1984, is an experienced veteran and he could definitely do better than that.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The scenario is weak and the potential of both main actors is wasted. There is a couple of jokes, but they mostly turn around Adam's dad, an aging playboy played by Kevin Kline. For the most of time this film is definitely NOT funny - and that is rarely good news for a comedy. As for the romance, well, there is hardly any - I saw more romantism in some butcher shops...<|SEP|><|SEP|>I give this film two stars only because I generally like Ashton Kutcher (I found him particularly good in &#34;Butterfly Effect&#34;, &#34;The Guardian&#34;, &#34;My boss's daughter&#34; and &#34;A lot like love&#34;) and of course I would watch Natalie Portman in ANYTHING... But this not-funny, not-romantic, occasionally vulgar film was for me a TERRRRIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT, nowhere near the quality of &#34;Notting Hill&#34;, &#34;While you were sleeping&#34;, &#34;When Harry meets Sally&#34; or &#34;Must love dogs&#34; - gosh, it wasn't even anywhere near the level of &#34;A lot like love&#34; (a lesser, albeit honest film).

I rather wish the rings had been left off and softer colors used. Back to the white noise... is this really white noise or just static? It does not seem to be as sound blocking as other white noise makers I've heard.

The author chose not to use quotation marks which seemed weird to me, especially with so much inner dialogue. Sometime I didn't know if the main character was speaking or thinking and had to re-read in several spots. It just seems lazy to me and I don't understand why someone would use this format. That's not why I'm giving the book 2 stars though. The author seemed to create a fairly realistic world, but then totally dropped the ball in several spots. For instance it seemed like nearly every character spoke like a redneck. Maybe the author is implying that only the rednecks will survive... Ha ha, but I don't know. The girl, a 15 year old that can't even remember what the world was like before it all happened leads me to believe it's been at least 10 years, yet she is able to find cheese crackers on a shelf in a store. I'm pretty sure that after 10 years there would be no food on the shelf and it certainly wouldn't be eatable. She was also fortunate to find Coke in a few occasions. Never Pepsi or Dr. Pepper. The most unrealistic thing about the book was that she was driving all over the country filling up her gas tank whenever she ran low. I found this totally unbelievable since most gas stations would be empty after 10 hours, but here she is 10 years later. Anyway, the story was just okay, I liked the 15 year old girl and even cheered for her. Several characters I could see clearly in my mind.

Did they not read the product description before purchasing? I guess not, so if anyone is interested let me state right up front: This Movie Is Not In 3-D.<|SEP|><|SEP|>I was not looking for 3D, and would've been irritated if I would've have to wear a pair of those red/blue 3D glasses to watch this movie. In general I find 3D annoying even with today's films, and if there is a 2D option available, I'll usually try to view films in that format. &#34;Amityville 3-D&#34; was one of a bunch of 80's flicks that tried to cash in on a resurgence of the 3-D craze; &#34;Friday the 13th III&#34;, &#34;Parasite&#34;, &#34;Comin' at Ya!&#34;, &#34;Jaws III&#34; and a few others made a half hearted attempt, but it just failed to catch on. (....of the bunch, the only film worth your while in that group is &#34;Friday the 13th III&#34;).<|SEP|><|SEP|>I really liked the premise of &#34;Amityville 3D&#34;, with Tony Roberts plays a reporter, Jack Baxter, who works for a magazine, traveling around and debunking phony psychics and disproving the supernatural. He's not only a skeptic, but actively disbelieves. He is in the middle of a nasty divorce, but still wants to maintain a relationship with his teenage daughter, (and look for Meg Ryan in an early role as one of the teen's friends).Baxter purchases the Amityville house so that he can move out of his cramped apartment, and begin working on writing a book.When bizarre stuff begins happening around his house, his former assistant claims the house is truly haunted, and that there is some bad juju centered around an old well found down in the basement.<|SEP|><|SEP|>This movie is a bit of a slog to get through. It's not horrible, but it is very slow. There are a few laughs found here and there, the unintentional kind, and there is a cool idea buried here, but the movie just flounders, with the &#34;action&#34; coming in the last 10 minutes or so.

Starter packs like these can allow them to use their money for something else the child needs. I also like the tops and covers that come with this pack because it makes preparation and travel convenient for mommy. I wish someone had given me a starter pack like this when I was first pregnant because it really would've made life easier."

It will go only as fast as you pedal so she likes how she can take it slow while watching tv, to improve circulation in her legs. However, if you are a young healthy person looking for a cardio workout in confined space / on the cheap, this is also very effective. Although of course not as effective at burning calories as running outside, if this is what you have to work with, it's doable. As a note, if you are using this for serious cardio (30+ minutes), I highly suggest buying some ankle weights (3-5 lbs per leg) and wearing them while you pedal - it makes it around twice as hard and is very effective. I bought some weights on amazon with the free shipping option for less than ten dollars."

When my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter sees a mug or cup in a book she says coffee with a big smile. Even though we don't allow her to drink it yet she knows what it is. I like trying new ways of making coffee and having it quick so when I could get this French press at a great price of course I had to. And since I love it so much I wanted to share my thoughts on it. First off it is very pretty. It's is a coffee pot that doesn't take much room and I don't have to hide away. I like that I don't need filters with it because I have accidentally ran out before and almost died when I did. It doesn't take a lot of coffee to fill it up and I can control the strength.

Finally, these have 3g of protein per serving and a tiny amount (about 2%) of iron.

I grew up reading comic books, as a kid the campiness worked, the PG feeling made sense. I still love comic books and comic book movies, but I no longer want the camp and the tackiness that comes with them. DC and Marvel have done a great job scaling it down, but out of the two, DC takes the cake. Assault on Arkham is a great example of that. Bad guys, killers, psychos going into an Asylum, you have to expect hard language, sexuality and violence, and the movie delivers. I hope DC continues this pattern."
20779,__label2__,5,Y,Shoes,B008FGSFJY,"Mizuno Men's Wave Creation 14 Running Shoe,Dude Blue,12 D US",Knee problems no more!,"I have been an avid Amazon shopper for many years, but this is the first product I am writing a review for, because of how impressed I am with the shoe. First off, I have had fairly extensive knee problems for many years, and have had eleven surgeries, gone through hours of physical therapy for these and for ITB syndrome, etc. To some degree the fact that I continue to be a runner is maybe a bit hard-nosed and stubborn, but I love it too much to think about giving it up. I've tried various shoes (about 12 different pairs of runners in the past three years alone), various knee braces/apparatus/sleeves, and varied running environments from rubber track to road to trail. I've always been an Asics guy, but have also tried New Balance, Adidas, Brooks and Nike. I've always tried to find a shoe with extra cushion, thinking it would absorb impact rather than distributing it to my knees. This is my first Mizuno product, which I decided to try after my Uncle recommended the brand to me based on his love for the Wave Riders; I was a bit leary, having tried multiple shoe brands, and decided on these Wave Creations based on his, and other reviews. This shoe does NOT offer my heel that super cushiony feel yet gives me the support I need to run pain-free, even days after my runs. I've begun to think that, like my sleep number bed, which I inflate to a more firm setting when I have back pain, that perhaps my thinking with shoes has been wrong all along, and that the more firm shoe is actually offering me more support in a similar manner. If you're like me, and have been continually frustrated with knee/ITB difficulties, consider this shoe; it may not be for everyone but it's done wonders for me. I have a high arch and am an under pronator; I am 5'11"" and at the time of this writing weigh an even 200 lbs. I recommend purchasing this shoe in a 1/2 size larger than your regular sneaks, but then I recommend the same for any running shoe as it had been advised to me by a professional several years ago and I've always stuck with that."

11844,__label2__,5,N,Video DVD,B000B5XOWA,Airplane! (Don't Call Me Shirley! Edition),I am serious. And don't call me Shirley,"Airplane! is not just A comedy movie, but one of THE comedy movies -- movies like ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"" ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Young Frankenstein.""<|SEP|><|SEP|>And honestly, it deserves to be in that august company. This is one of the funniest movies ever, with a constant barrage of gags, running jokes, spoofs and parodies of various movies (""Saturday Night Fever,"" to name one) -- it never stoops to pretending to have any dramatic weight, but simply buries you in hilarity. Surely you'll enjoy this!<|SEP|><|SEP|>Desperate to win back his ex-girlfriend Elaine (Julie Hagerty) , former pilot Ted Striker (Robert Hays) follows her on an outgoing plane. It's actually his postwar trauma about planes that has led to their breakup, and now he boards the plane -- along with nuns, Hare Krishnas, an ill child, jive guys, and many others -- to prove his love for her.<|SEP|><|SEP|>But as he tells stories of his romance to increasingly suicidal passengers, a REAL crisis arises: food poisoning! All the fish on the flight have gone bad, causing most of the passengers and the whole flight crew to become horribly ill. Only Ted has the chance to land the plane safely, with the guidance of the increasingly erratic people on the ground, and the advice of a kindly but not too helpful doctor (Leslie Nielson).<|SEP|><|SEP|>""Airplane!"" bombards you with jokes -- crude jokes (boobs!), pop culture references (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), word puns (""... and don't call me Shirley""), parodies of other movies, characters being overly literal, random gags (Captain Oveur suffering the food poisoning symptoms) and running gags that they milk just long enough (""Looks like I picked the wrong week to stop..."").<|SEP|><|SEP|>In other words, it's packed with so many jokes that it nearly explodes. And yet it flows naturally from one ridiculous gag to the next, like a vast patchwork quilt of hilarity where everything fits. Directors Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker never let the humor go slack;the one sentimental moment in the movie is handled as a parody (""Win one for the Zipper!"") and the mortal peril they're in is played for laughs.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Example: when the flight crew gets sick, Elaine has to activate the autopilot... which is a big inflatable faux-pilot. When he later deflates, she has to blow him back up in a very suggestive way.<|SEP|><|SEP|>And all the acting is spot-on -- everybody plays their roles with exaggerated seriousness, whether it's Hays' lethally boring tales of his life or Nielson providing ""uplifting"" encouragement at all the wrong times. Even the small roles are handled with deadly, hammy seriousness.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Other highlights include Peter Graves as the not-so-secretly gay pilot (""Joey, do you like movies about gladiators?""), Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as Roger Murdock as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Hagerty as the baby-voiced Elaine, and Robert Stack as the grizzled, macho yet insane Rex Kramer.<|SEP|><|SEP|>A mere description of a plot and a few of the jokes can't sufficiently describe ""Airplane!"", one of the greatest comedy movies of all time. Insanely, uproariously funny."

11529,__label2__,4,N,Video DVD,B00Q5996EQ,Gone Girl Blu-ray,"(3.5 STARS) Unbelievable, Still Darkly Entertaining","“Gone Girl” is a David Fincher thriller, and that will tell you something about the film. This is a story about the “missing Amy,” which is dark, twisted and unpredictable. I am not saying this is one of the greatest mysteries ever filmed. It simply is not, because the script is, if scrutinized closely, full of illogical things. Still, it is darkly entertaining enough to forget these plot holes, thanks to the slick direction and fine acting.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The story starts with Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck), whose beautiful wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) goes missing. The police investigation starts, followed by heavy press coverage. The Nick slowly realizes that despite their five-year marriage, he knew so little about his wife. Not only that; people start to think that Nick is not what he seems.<|SEP|><|SEP|>So what really happened? “Gone Girl” takes time in unfolding its complicated story, and maybe too much time. (It runs about 150 minutes.) But don’t ever expect something like “Zodiac,” or a mystery based on realism. What happens in the last 30 minutes of “Gone Girl” is so incredible.<|SEP|><|SEP|>I’m giving four stars because of some of the effective performances from the cast, including Carrie Coon as Nick’s twin sister Margo. Perhaps her likeable character is the most convincing part of the film."
11870,__label2__,4,N,Video DVD,B00JHH22O4,The Legend of Hell House [Blu-ray],The Legend of Hell House receives a nice blu-ray upgrade with good extras,"Horror or suspense movies that take place in haunted houses are tough to do. The remake of ""The Haunting"", for example, managed to be too literal and show too much which undermined its effectiveness especially compared to Robert Wise's spare, stark original film which was much more about atmosphere. Richard Matheson's novel (""Hell House"")and screenplay for ""The Legend of Hell House"" was something of a homage to Shirley Jackson's novel ""The Haunting of Hill House"" (and Robert Wise's classic film adapted from it ""The Haunting""). The two novels and films have the same basic premise but go in different directions with them. Physicist Lionel Barrett (Clive Reville)is hired to investigate the possibility of life after death. The location selected is that of the Belasco House once owned by the imposing Emeric Belasco. According to legend, Belasco was a sexual pervert who tortured his victims and their spirits supposedly still reside inside its walls. Barrett hires two different mediums to participate in the experiment with him and his wife ((Gayle Hunnicutt). The first psychic is Ben Fischer (the late Roddy MacDowall)a survivor of a previous experiment in the house who reluctantly agrees to participate because he needs the money. The second Florence Tanner (Pamela Franklin)has her own motivation for wanting to join the party. Shout Factory does a nice job of renovating Hell House for its Blu-ray debut. The film has never looked quite this good--images are quite nice with depth and there's little to no debris evident in this transfer. There are occasionally small scratches and speckles but, on the whole, the film looks quite nice. I was a bit concerned, not because Shout Factory hasn't put out good product before, because this is more of a cult film that wouldn't normally receive the TLC that it deserves. The audio is clear with the original mono soundtrack receiving a nice sounding transfer. This version does not include the 4.0 mix that Fox made for the DVD. Subtitles are provided in English. The moody score sounds quite nice here as well. The special features are pretty good as well. They may not be as extensive as what Shout provided for some other releases, but they make up for quantity with quality. We get a 30 minute interview with director John Hough. Hough has directed a number of b-movie classics and provides insight into his approach in shooting ""The Legend of Hell House"" as well as ""Dirty Mary and Crazy Larry"" another cult classic that he is responsible for. The second major extra is an audio interview with Pamela Franklin presented as an audio commentary track. While there are long periods of silence, she does provide an interesting contrast to some of Hough's observations. We also get a photo gallery, vintage radio spots and the theatrical trailer rounding out the extras for this release. As usual Shout provides us with a reversable cover--the outside is the original theatrical poster while there's newly commission artwork on the reverse. ""The Legend of Hell House"" is a film that I didn't think would receive a Blu-ray transfer and I've always enjoyed and admired what Hough, Matheson and the cast did with their small budgeted film. I'm a sucker for 70's horror films when they are well made and ""Hell House"" falls into that category. Fans will enjoy this as the transfer is exceptionally good with nice extras. Recommended."

Take a vise grip plier and bend out the metal side track about 2 inches after the curve from vertical to horizontal. Which is sold by Sanford and Son Overhead Doors too. The only difference is that these are sealed bearings. For the bottom roller, bend out a section of track 6 inches before the bend from vertical to horizontal. Align the bottom roller to the open section of the track pop out the roller and replace it. Bend back the track. Align one of the rollers and use a large screwdriver between the track and side of the roller to pop the roller out of the track. Of course you will have to hold up the section of the garage door. Replace the old roller and pop in the new roller into the track. Repeat for the rest of the rollers except for the bottom roller. Use the plier and bend back the track.

10754,__label2__,3,N,Video DVD,B006ZV6Y8A,Luci Mie Traditrici,"Delightfully innovative opera, but this DVD release is flawed","The Italian composer Salvatore Sciarrino is both steeped in tradition and deeply avant-garde at the same time. Inspired by the classical canon, he nonetheless transforms that inheritance through extended techniques: strings play ghostly harmonics, wind performers overblow notes or produce multiphonics. Take, for example, his &#34;Sei Capricci&#34; for violin (1976, best heard on [[ASIN:B000GLKKT4 Coviello disc]]) where what looks like conventional Paganini-like writing in the score sounds when performed as sparkling, ethereal sounds.<|SEP|><|SEP|>His 1998 opera &#34;Luci mie traditrici&#34; (My Treacherous Eyes, sometimes retitled &#34;Killing Flower&#34;) applies that style to vocal writing with remarkable effect. The simple plot is inspired by the story of Gesualdo, the Renaissance composer who discovered that his wife was cheating on him, and then murdered her and her lover in bed, his aristocratic rank protecting him from prosecution. Hearing that Alfred Schnittke was preparing an opera on the same theme, Sciarrino deleted overt references to Gesualdo (and quotations of Gesualdo's music), and he chose to adapt 17th-century playwright Giacinto Andrea Cicognini's own retelling of Gesualdo under the title &#34;Il tradimento per l'onore&#34;.<|SEP|><|SEP|>As the opera opens, a Dutchess (soprano, here Nina Tarandek) and Duke (baritone, Christian Miedl) pledge eternal love to each other. Soon, however, the Dutchess is seduced by a Guest (counter-tenor, Roland Schneider), and the tryst is reported to the Duke by a Servant (tenor, Simon Bode). Thus ends the first act. In the second, the Duke prepares the murder of the Guest and then his wife, at which this hour-long staging comes to a sudden end.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The vocal writing is eerie, lines thrown out scattershot, long-held notes at the beginning collapsing into a series of grace notes. The ensemble of 22 players (winds, strings and bass drum) produces Sciarrino's characteristic soundworld of skittering, noctural sounds. While avant-garde, the musical accompaniment is not noisy or abstract, instead it seems to depict the unspoken thoughts of the characters. As a prologue to the opera, we hear a snippet of pure Renaissance-era music, and later in the opera this same material is heard transformed through Sciarrino's extended techniques. The action is stylized, with for example the Dutchess and Guest's tryst expressed only through repetition of suggestive lines and pregnant pauses. The austere and ritualistic proceedings remind this viewer of drama from some non-Western culture, such as kabuki.<|SEP|><|SEP|>In this DVD, Marco Angius leads the Ensemble Algoritmo in a July 2010 production. How does this stack up against other recordings? This seems to be the same performance as captured on a 2011 [[ASIN:B0050JPFMO Stradivarius disc]]. There is an [[ASIN:B00013D4OK earlier Stradivarius disc]] where the Ensemble Risognanze performs, but I have not heard that yet. I am familiar with the Klangforum Wien/Beat Furrer performance [[ASIN:B00005JSJH on Kairos]], and that is somewhat superior in terms of sound (the ensemble being more prominent in the mix). However, the Algoritmo/Angius production is deftly performed and Sciarrino himself calls it definitive.<|SEP|><|SEP|>While its nice to have at least some visuals, I am not entirely happy with this DVD. It's bad enough that this was released solely in DVD instead of Blu-ray, but even the DVD transfer is flawed: with artifacts visible in near every shot. Was this shot for television broadcast and then re-encoded for DVD? The DVD does come with a bonus where the singers, Angius and the Ensemble Algoritmo rehearsing the piece and discuss how they approach Scarrino's music.<|SEP|><|SEP|>So while I would consider &#34;Luci mie traditrici&#34; a four-star affair (impressive, though not among the greatest operas I've ever seen), that poor quality of the visuals leads me to dock a star. I'm sorry I have to do that, since I suppose we should be grateful we get avideo of this avant-garde opera at all."

18243,__label2__,2,Y,Home Entertainment,B004GK0GKO,WD TV Live Hub 1TB Media Center (Old Model),"Great potential, but ultimately unreliable","We've been using the Western Digital WD TV Live Hub 1 TB Media Center for 9 months or so and when it works, it provides a very nice entertainment experience. The image and sound quality are great, the system plays back almost any file format that you feed it, and, when it can find/stay connected, playback of media from other devices on our network works well. We keep our media on a NAS and so the Hub's NAS support was a major determining factor for us, but the support is not very strong.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The Media Library feature would be fantastic, if it worked. This feature grabs and displays metadata for your media, like screencaps, reviews and cast details from videos, in a browseable interface. It also (supposedly) tracks recently added media and recently viewed/listened media, to help you more easily access things that are in your heavy rotation. The few times that system has been able to scan our media (less than 100 GB of movies, approximately 500 GB of music), we've really liked this feature. The initial library scan takes hours and even if we set the system to not rescan on reboot, it does anyway. We thought maybe we were asking too much for the Library to work with our NAS (although, were disappointed that that might ebe the case), so we copied our media to the Hub's drive. But even playback of local media is sketchy -- on start-up, the system can take anywhere from 3 to 5 minutes before it can find media on _its own drive_. And anytime you switch sources, say from the Hub's hard drive to a network share, the scanning has to be done again for the Library to function.<|SEP|><|SEP|>If you don't care about any of the advanced features, or the number of clicks and pauses it may take to play back a song or video, the Hub _does_ work as a basic media playback device. But that's not how Western Digital advertises (or charges for) it.<|SEP|><|SEP|>We've give the Hub a fair shot -- we're relatively technically adept in my household and we've read manuals and forums and have tried a variety of settings to no avail. We even tested it beyond the Amazon return window, hoping a charmed combo of settings or a firmware upgrade might fix these issues, but the upgrades seem to center on the addition of new services, like Spotify or MLB.com and we've noticed no improvement in the issues that plague us. That sort of expansion is welcome, but we'd rather the focus was on making the device's basics solid. We're stuck with the Western Digital WD TV Live Hub, but we don't recommend it."

Unfortunately, I'm pretty disappointed. First, the blow mold case is exactly like the pic (which I guess makes sense) - there's no top, just what you see, which doesn't really make any sense, but whatever - I wouldn't take a star off for that. I'm dropping stars because the sizing isn't right. I've used the 10, 14, 17, and 18 so far. The 18 is way off on the bolts I used it on (front suspension on my car). The 5 deg. ratcheting does you no good if you've got 15 deg. of slop in the fit. For the record, the bolt was an 18, and my other wrenches and sockets fit it perfectly. The 10 was off as well, but not nearly as bad as the 18, and the others were close but still worse than most of my other tools.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The other reason I drop a star is because they're flimsy and skinny. With an XL set like this you expect more heft. When I'm really pulling on the wrench it feels like it's going to flip over or crumple or something. There's plenty of strength in the direction you need, but the thinness in the other direction doesn't inspire me to really pull on them, which is the point of an XL wrench.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The good: They appear well made, nice finish, well marked, the ratcheting mechanism is crisp and solid. The bad doesn't come out until you go to use it, and then it's just disappointing."

909,__label1__,2,N,Books,61995045,The Upside of Irrationality: The Unexpected Benefits of Defying Logic,"Better, But Not Excellent","Interesting book. It is better than &#34;Predictably Irrational.&#34; Indeed, people are often irrational, but sometimes what appears to be rational is not. But even in this book, Ariely misses one of the obvious and major reasons people make SEEMINGLY irrational decisions, that are actually quite reasonable and rational from an individual perspective. Our government has increasingly alienated people from individual responsibility and from other citizens, and it has taken the risk out of making decisions.<|SEP|><|SEP|>As long as they receive government benefits and hand-outs, most citizens will not look behind the &#34;wizard's curtain.&#34; Nevertheless, modern U.S. Government is unlike any before. Citizens can observe that government is now nothing more than an unsustainable Ponzi scheme. A broad tax base of new taxpayers is needed every year just to pay basic government expenses. Yet, each year, the tax base shrinks (population of taxpayers decreases) and government expenses rise. In the face of this disaster, has government made an all-out effort to cut expenses? Of course not. Government is raising taxes to dangerous and debilitating levels, borrowing huge amounts of money from foreigners, and INCREASING EXPENSES. Obama has quadrupled-down on failure, creating the largest deficit ever. If a private citizen or corporation ran its affairs in this manner, it would be criminally procescuted for fraud.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Citizens have internalized the government's ongoing propaganda-of-irresponsibility, and they observe the government's example of irrationality and emotionalism. And now the People are behaving just like their government. This is what government &#34;nudging&#34; has created.<|SEP|><|SEP|>For over 60 years now, citizens have been detached from the effects of their negative decisions, whether concerning lifestyle or the effects of bad financial choices. With a constant barrage of government-sponsored propaganda; emotionalism and group-politics have replaced rationality as the bases for decision-making. And modern U.S. government propaganda is the most effective in history, as it employs all the lessons learned and techniques of behavior manipulation from the disciplines of sociology, psychological warfare, and psychology over the past 100 years. There are ongoing propaganda programs promoting and encouraging government provided medical care, unemployment insurance, welfare and social security benefits, free monthly income even for young people, and the chance of filing a lawsuit or getting the government involved when investments go bad. The government conditions citizens to incorrectly believe that correlation is the same as causation; and that appearances and emotional intent are the same as results. The government's goal: promote reliance on government and avoidance of individual responsibility, thought and judgment. Why? To insure ease of public manipulation and the political power of certain groups. Obama oligarch, Cass Sunstein, refers to this conditioning, manipulation and control of citizens as &#34;nudging.&#34;<|SEP|><|SEP|>For example, during the recent &#34;subprime mortgage crisis,&#34; which Ariely cites as an example of irrationality, all parties behaved rationally and reasonably, EXCEPT the supposedly rational U.S. Government. Homeowners who could not afford houses knew the government was guaranteeing the loans and, given their minimal down payments, they knew they had little to lose from foreclosure if they could not make payments. Thus, it made perfect sense from their perspective to risk buying homes they could not afford. Similarly, lenders knew the loans were government guaranteed, and the government was threatening lenders with lawsuits and fines if they did not make loans to unqualified buyers, so the lenders knew they had little risk in making imprudent loans. In fact, lenders faced greater risk from government harassment if they did NOT make imprudent loans. Investors in those loans also acted rationally. They understood, correctly, that the government would not allow homeowners, lenders and investors to lose billions or trillions of dollars on a program the government forced on the country. Thus, investors bought loans they knew would probably go into default, because, even if they received no payments from borrowers, the government would rescue financial institutions and investors, which it did. Finally, the only party that did not act rationally was the U.S. government. First, it &#34;incentivized&#34; imprudent economic activity by taking the risk from lenders, borrowers and investors. Then, to make matters much worse, it actually rewarded and has now promoted imprudent financial activity by rescuing all parties to the government created mortgage &#34;crisis.&#34;<|SEP|><|SEP|>Over the past 60 years, governments have aggressively promoted irrational risk-taking (which is actually rational for the individual, since he risks nothing), which has spread to all areas of individual human endeavor. Citizens are increasingly losing their good judgment, since the world in which they live is a fiction created by the government, bearing no relation to the real world of finance, economics, and survival based on good decisions. Thus, contrary to Ariely's thesis, the forces of &#34;irrationality&#34; are not hidden. Irrationality is a necessary part of modern government. In fact, many of the programs created by the government have the irrational and exact opposite effect than the one intended. For example, the 1960s &#34;Great Society&#34; and &#34;War on Poverty,&#34; created more poverty. The War on Gun Ownership has resulted in more violence by criminals. The welfare system designed to help families, destroyed families, and created several generations of illegitimate children. Despite billions spent on education; Math, Science and intelligence testing scores are in decline. This is because foolish government bureaucrats and academics have confused correlation with causation. Education does not make people successful. Rather, successful, intelligent people are more likely to finish their education and continue on with their successful lives. It is a waste of money to try to over-educate an unintelligent individual, who should be directed to trade training. Instead, politicians tell us it is preferable students receive diluted, fake degrees. Amazingly, not only does the government not encourage the most intelligent and productive citizens to have children, but instead, the government now subsidizes and promotes the breeding of the least intelligent inhabitants of the country. Incredibly, in many cases, the people receiving these breeding subsidies are not even citizens! There is insufficient space here for a complete list of government irrationalities.<|SEP|><|SEP|>It is enough to note that modern government employs techniques similar to the &#34;Cargo Cult&#34; islanders who, by using sympathetic magic, thought that creating the superficial appearances of a system (fake airport and planes), would bring material reward (delivery of cargo). Like modern politicians, the Cargo Cult confused correlation with causation. Citizens have learned the lessons of government irrationality and it has conditioned individual behavior. Many academics and intellectuals, such as Ariely, have lost sight of the fact that human beings are animals that respond in ways that are similar to organisms and other animals. That is, they seek the easiest path to satisfaction of needs and emotions, and avoid effort and thought whenever possible. This is particularly true of individuals subjected to prolonged government propaganda campaigns. Government cannot force one to be successful, but it can set up conditions promoting irrationality and failure, as the U.S. has done. The best antidote to predictable government irrationality is to place individuals back in touch with reality, that is, with the true effects of their decisions. Despite Ariely's faulty analysis, hedoes unwittingly show the many ways in which government directly and indirectly promotes irrationality."

10889,__label2__,4,N,Video DVD,B007X0TTXE,Don 2 [Blu-ray] (Shah Rukh Khan / Hindi Movie / Bollywood Film / Indian Cinema),"It is not just difficult to predict all the plot twists in Don 2, it's impossible!","That review title above is a straight up fib. It's not at all difficult to predict all the plot twists in DON 2. But so what? For fans of Shahrukh Khan and for those who relish slick action thrillers, DON 2 checks all the boxes. It's been five years since the events in DON, five years since that shocking final reveal. But some things don't change. These days, our guy is still running game on the underworld, still outfoxing the badge and his competitors. The woman he betrayed, Roma Bhagat (Priyanka Chopra), is now an Interpol officer. She's obsessed with nabbing him.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The film opens with Don holding it down as the undisputed kingpin of the Asian underworld, except that he's now got his eye on a take over of the European drug cartel. On the French Riviera, the European bosses attend an emergency meeting to discuss Don's recent actions. Don is jeopardizing their drug empire by undercutting the asking price of their product. What they decide on is inevitable.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Back in Malaysia, Don gets wind of the contract on his head in the rudest of manners. There and then, he determines to be a free man once and for all. He sets into motion one of those whirlwind capers, key elements of which hinge on the springing of his old enemy from prison (Boman Irani) and a daring heist in Berlin. But Don finds himself navigating a nest of vipers, his accomplices composed of deceitful villains. With law enforcement nipping at his heels, has Don at last bitten off more than he can chew? Or does that iconic phrase still hold true? ""Don ko pakadna mushkil hi nahi, namumkim hai."" Translation: ""It is not just difficult to catch Don, it's impossible!""<|SEP|><|SEP|>If you're anticipating a retread of the 2006 film, you need to turn in your anticipating badge. For one thing, there aren't so many swerves in this one. Don does assume a disguise, but it's not as relevant to the plot as much as it is a chance to showcase Hrithik Roshan in a cool cameo (Hrithik even dances with Priyanka).And if that really is Hrithik saying Don's dialogue, then big ups to him for nicely matching Shahrukh's voice and cadence. Don is so gifted, as part of his disguise, he grew a few inches.<|SEP|><|SEP|>I thought Priyanka Chopra did well in a role that required her character, Roma, to be conflicted. Don is so magnetic that Roma still can't help but feel that attraction, never mind that Don had betrayed her, never mind that he'd murdered her brother. Thankfully, the film keeps this sub-plot mostly on simmer, never allows it to take over the narrative. Lara Dutta has a lesser role, filling in for Ishaa Koppikar as Don's most trusted companion. Both women look absolutely devastating!<|SEP|><|SEP|>The manly man's credo: Give me my popcorn and a comfy sofa and babes to ogle and lots of fight scenes and explosions... and I'm good. Because sometimes and maybe most times, I dispense with the artsy-fartsy stuff and I demand to be entertained by a loud action blockbuster. DON 2 lacks the smarts and fascinating twists of the 2006 film. And I don't know that it was a sound move to inject a sliver of conscience into Don. What made him unique was that he was an unrepentant anti-hero, a straight up, no good villain. Or maybe it doesn't matter. Shahrukh Khan's larger-than-life charisma and his showmanship are stamped onto the screen and your eyes are glued to the guy. Shahrukh also performs his own stunts, again perpetuating the notion that absolutely no one can fill his shoes. I guess, one other contention is that I prefer Don to apply his wits to achieve his ends. Here, he frequently resorts to action hero methods. Ultimately, the 2006 film had built up so much cachet I can't dog on its sequel too much. DON 2 is the Hindi version of MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. It's over-the-top and preposterous and great bloody fun. As a fan of Bollywood cinema, I think it's always a treat whenever Boman Irani plays the bad guy. Whether in drama or thriller or comedy, Boman Irani is effortless. There aren't alot of musical numbers here (I think, three). But the tracks all carry strains of ""Main Hoon Don,"" a club banger from the 2006 film and one of the most addictive, catchy Bollywood songs ever. Okay, another beef? How much more clever would it have been if, instead of Hrithik Roshan, it was Abhishek Bachan whose face Don assumes? Abhishek looks enough like his dad, Amitabh, who played the original Don in 1978, that the reference would've been awesome.<|SEP|><|SEP|>What I have is the 2-disc DVD set. Disc 1 has the feature presentation, available with English sub-titles and the option to jump to any of the film's three musical segments (this last feature is also available on Disc 2). Disc 2 has the following bonus features:<|SEP|><|SEP|>- Making Of featurette (mostly in English, running time 40 minutes)<|SEP|>- Songs: ""Zaraa Dil Ko Thaam Lo,"" Hai Ye Maya,"" ""Dushman Mera""<|SEP|>- (Promotional?) Music Video from DON 2 featuring Shahrukh Khan: ""Mujhko Pehchaanlo"""

12774,__label2__,1,N,PC,B004275EO4,Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi HD USB Audio System with Phono Preamp,They have always impressed me until now.,"This is my 9th Soundblaster product, and 12th Creative product. They have always impressed me until now. I run audio out via SPDIF to a NAD pre-amp, then to 4 NAD power amps, finishing at mixed brands of in wall speakers and subs throughout the house. The level of the SPDIF out was weak compared to my previous sound card(s), and required more than twice the amplification. I am not going to be running my amps full tilt all the time to make up for a weak input signal. The built in headphone amp is a joke. Volume level/power was no better than plugging direct into the laptop's factory soundcard. No EQ is bundled with this unit, I had to install old Creative software. Burn option in Creative MediaSource 5 magically disappeared, I consulted customer service, and was told this product does not support MediaSource (MediaSource won't burn unless a qualifying Creative device is connected). How can YOUR software not support YOUR hardware?! How does the Creative sound card model I am using have anything to do with transferring files to a CD?!?! Creative did not respond to further inquires on this compatibility issue. Sound quality lacks as compared to previous SoundBlasters, it was dull and flat. Overall sounded poor, through a mix of Klipsch, Polk, Boston Acoustics, and even a single pair of Martin Logan Edges. Out of no where, a click and pop appeared between tracks in MediaSource. Said clicks/pop not present with previous PC/Soundcard. I have submitted for a refund. I am going back to my desktop PC, with a Soundblaster X-Fi Titanium until I figure out a better laptop option. Considering the Cambridge Audio DacMagic Plus or axing the computer all together for a network media center. Everyone is entitled to a flop. Creative proved themselves to me over years of use and many products. I can get over a single flop. But not responding to additional inquiries regarding product quality and compatibility issues is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. I have used SoundBlaster exclusively since my 8bit ISA mounted &#34;Game Blaster&#34; card purchased from Radio Shack in the late 80's early 90's. Creative has lost a decades long customer not from product quality, but from poor customer service. Shame on you, and good riddance. This was run on: Dell Latitude E6540 Intel Core i7-4810MQ @ 2.8ghz 8Gb RAM Win7 64 bit Sound card was purchased direct from the Creative website, not through Amazon. However, Amazon fulfills their orders... **UPDATE** Creative has finally responded, and is accepting the return/refund. They are NOT paying for shipping."

In actuality it is one of the worst, dumbest movies ever made. However, I think that is much of the point of these offbeat movies made for the SyFy Network. You could easily make an argument that for investment purposes, this may be one of the best movies ever. Made for $1 million, it's a big hit. So here's the deal.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Fin Shepard (Ian Ziering) is a former surfing champ who now owns a bar on the beach near L. A. As a hurricane brews off the Mexican coast, strong winds move up the California shoreline. Water spouts begin to appear at the same time as a large school of sharks. Before you know it, the large water spouts pick up the sharks and start depositing them inland. At the same time the tropical storm is flooding everything. This give the re-deposited sharks access to the storm drains as well as an occasional swimming pool.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Fin along with an Australian surfing buddy Baz (Jaason Simmons), George (John Heard), the local drunk and a hot employee named Nova (Cassie Scerbo) head for the hills (literally) to look in on Fin's ex-wife, April (a stone faced Tara Reid), his teenage daughter, Claudia (Aubrey Peeples) and college aged son, Matt (Chuck Hittinger). Well Matt's away at flight school or something, April and Claudia insist they don't need help. That is until a flying shark eats April's new boyfriend.<|SEP|><|SEP|>So most of the movie has sharks appearing from everywhere eating everything and everyone in their path. Fin and company concoct a plan to have flyboy Matt and Nova take a helicopter up into the now 3 tornados and toss in an improvised bomb which will defuse the tornado and kill the sharks contained therein. And guess what? It works. One casualty is Nova when she is taken off guard and swallowed by a flying great white shark.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Although for most of the movie, I thought Nova was going to be Fin's girlfriend, it turns out she's better suited for son Matt. That way Fin can reunite with April. But wait, Nova was swallowed by the great white. No matter. Fin armed with a chain saw, manages to find the same fish and dive in head first, cutting his way out from the inside and saving Nova for Matt. I have to admit to laughing out loud for much of the film. I was especially caught up in several lines uttered that came verbatim from ""Jaws."" Like I said, this may be the worst or best movie ever."

So much power. My husband charged his android phone to 75% (because he then had to use the thing), I charged my iPhone 5S multiple times, and we're still on the first charging. It managed to charge overnight. I had my iPhone going at full tilt (Waze was running, as well as YouTube, and LTE turned on) on my trip on the bus. I was teetering on 20% battery life. In an hour, while using my phone with all the things running, I managed to get back up to 75% battery while plugged into the 2 amp side. The battery amount left over display is really helpful, because those freaking dots that other battery backups have don't tell you anything.<|SEP|><|SEP|>We own a [[ASIN:B003ZBZ64Q External Battery, New Trent iCarrier 12000mAh Portable Dual USB Port External Battery Charger/Power Pack for Smartphones, iPhone 6, Iphone 6 Plus, S5, Nexus 6, Note 4, Tablets, iPad Air 2, iPad mini 3, and more (Now w/Micro-USB charge port)]] that I've had for a couple of years now. Look at the price on that thing, and compare it to the price for the TSST one. It's night and day, isn't it? The amount of mAh on this one isn't that far behind the NewTrent one, but this one costs like half of the other one. Might as well buy two of these if you need that much battery charge.<|SEP|><|SEP|>It is heavy though (like a pound or so), so if you're one of those people who hates carrying extra weight, then you'll be stuck with a lower capacity battery, because the amount of charging you get out of this sucker is very good. You can't have it all, can you? Either you sacrifice the amount of charge you get, or sacrifice having a heavy little brick in your bag.<|SEP|><|SEP|>This is thicker and slightly larger than my iPhone, but it's small enough to fit into a regular sized handbag or backpack. It does fit into my pocket for those times that I want to talk on the phone while having the phone charge, and walk around (you'd be surprised how frequent that occurrence happens). When I do so in my pyjamas, it will bang against my leg, so I make sure to just slide the battery thingy into the pocket of my hoodie or something.<|SEP|><|SEP|>For what you're paying for the unit, this is a very slick little device. It's got sensible features that you will find yourself wishing in all your other devices. It's also pretty enough that other people comment on it. Very much worth the money."
16085,__label2__,5,N,Camera,B00A2BVBTG,Canon EF 35mm f/2 IS USM Wide-Angle Lens,Great lens... once I got used to it!,"I really like this lens. At first I was unimpressed - it did not seem any better than my 28/1.8 (which I also like quite a bit) and I considered returning it. IS seemed unnecessary, sharpness about the same as the 28/1.8 beyond f/2.8 or so, plus it's bigger than that lens. But I started to notice things that turned me.<|SEP|><|SEP|>First, 35mm focal length simply works better for me than 28mm. I always preferred the 28mm to my 50mm, but 28mm was always a bit wide - 35mm is perfect. I doubt I'll reach for either 28 or 50 much anymore, and I may end up selling them.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Secondly, the colors this lens produces are really quite pleasing, as is the smoothness of out-of-focus regions. The 28mm produced some funky results in this area sometimes, depending on the lighting. Not sure how to describe the issue technically, but I have found no such issue with the 35/2 IS.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Third, even though it does improve upon stopping down, the 35/2 IS is sharp wide open. The 28/1.8 and 50/1.4 are not up to snuff in this regard. I had rationalized myself around that not being an issue on the older lenses, but it is really quite nice to be able to use a lens wide open and be confident in the results - this is the case with the 35/2 IS. The wide aperture after all is one of the main reasons to use a prime - it feels great to be able to use it there with confidence!<|SEP|><|SEP|>Lastly, IS and I are on speaking terms again. At first, I actively disliked this feature - I didn't trust it in rapid shooting situations when I didn't think it would have time to settle (turned out to be unfounded), and it just seemed unnecessary at this focal length. But I have bumped into a few situations so far when it did actually make a difference (late night, relatively long exposures, shooting scenes with moving water, etc). And I will probably find it very useful if I ever start doing any DSLR video work. I'd probably like this lens even better if it were made without IS and was $200cheaper and smaller, but I have come to terms with the IS as a useful feature.<|SEP|><|SEP|>One other opinion: Canon's new pricing scheme makes sense for this lens. This is a $500 lens, not an $850 lens."

The unfortunate thing is that the quality of the reeds vary greatly from one reed to another, even within the same box of 10 reeds. This is not unique to Vandorens but with all the other reeds too, from what I hear from expert level players.<|SEP|><|SEP|>To deal with varying quality of the reeds, what we have been doing is opening up several reeds at a time, then putting them in a cup of warm water, then having my son play with them for several minutes at a time. Inevitably he can pick out which reeds play the best immediately. Then we label these reeds by marking the back of the reed with a sharpee 1, 2, 3 or 4 stars. We would do this over time with all 10 reeds until all the reeds are categorized. What we have also learned is that over time, some reeds take a bit of &#34;breaking in&#34; period, so it may have to be upgraded from a 2* to 3* or 4*, and other previously highly rated reed may be downgraded over time.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Pick up some of these and you'll be happy! http://amzn.to/1GNce4U"

12798,__label2__,5,Y,Toys,B0033UFZ6S,Disney Official Trading Pin Lot of 100 Lapel Collector Pins,Disney Official Trading Pins,"The wife and I are big Disney fans. We are retired so we can travel down to ?Walt /Disney World any time we want from our Northern Illinois home. We also belong to the Disney Vacation Club, so we always have a place to stay and we like to take friends and family down to enjoy the Disney experience with us. One of our vices is trading pins with cast members. We have albums of pins back home which we fill with &#34;keepers&#34; when we trade.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Pin trading can be very expensive when you buy your traders at the Disney stores - starting at $7 each and higher, you can run into serious money getting a stock of pins for trading. I once tried buying cheap lots of pins on e-bay, but when I got them, they were obvious fakes/knock-offs. You can tell the fake ones because the edges of the pins are ragged from poor quality molds and the colors are washed out and dull. You can compare the real thing side by side with the same pin that is fake and see the obvious difference. So, that was the one and only time I bought on e-bay. I do not like to trade fake pins and many of the Disney cast members are trained to watch for the fakes. They are the ones who pointed out the difference to us. Some will still trade you for a fake pin (make the customer happy) but I do not like to operate that way.<|SEP|><|SEP|>So, I am always looking for sources for real pins. These lots caught my eye because of the price - 88-cents each for pins. This is a great buy, and the seller says they are official trading pins. I ended up buying 3 lots because my 2 sisters wanted some for their next trip down and the wife and I are going down in March. So, this was our new stock for trading. The shipment came in 3 boxes. I picked one and sent the other 2 to my sisters to fight over.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Okay - my previous source (not Amazon.com) was selling pins for $1.50 each. A good price and we never found fakes. But the previous supplier also allowed duplicates in lots. Since we used them for trading, that was not a big deal. But we rarely found pins in these lots that we wanted to keep. So, not expecting much difference - other than the price - we opened our box from this supplier (Kerrie's Limited) and boy were we surprised. Not only was each pin different, but there were pins we had never seen before and we have been collecting for a long time. There were some Euro-Disney pins too. We had a great time going through these and picking out &#34;keepers&#34; for our own albums and reserving the others for trading.on our next trip. I am glad we bought 100 pins because we took a big chunk of those for keepers and that still left us some for trading. Note: I did find some fake pins but only 3 out of the 100 were faked. With the number of fake pins out there, I can see how the fake ones can infiltrate good lots. I do not fault the seller for a few fake pins as most people would not notice unless you know what to look for. The other 97 pins were great and these are a great value.<|SEP|><|SEP|>My sisters called excitedly when they received the other 2 boxes. They found the same thing - great pins they had never seen before and lots of keepers for their own albums but still enough left over to take down to Orlando on their next trip. One box had a few fakes in it, but the other one had all original pins.<|SEP|><|SEP|>So, we are all very happy. I would buy from this vendor again. Great deal!"

So I decided to try out this bad boy. I do believe that the price is not a fair price for what you are getting and plus Fotodiox is at the same time selling the same item but just not for a speed light but for an Alien Bee strobe and different mount for about $90. Now, I bring this up because I don't feel that the speedlight mount bracket is of much value due to it not being strong enough to hold the beauty dish without using a pair of pliers to tighten it. I use a mix of speedlights and portable strobes. Honestly, this beauty dish works great with strobes when using the correct strobe mount to the beauty dish, but Fotodiox needs to make their speedlight mount brackets better (stronger) and more suited for the beauty dish. Also be very careful about not dropping this on the ground too hard. One, the mental is soft and nowhere near a Mola dish and also the way they have connected the dish to the mount on the back isn't sturdy at all. Mine fell to the ground and the little rivets holding it together pulled out and I had to take some bolts and nuts and re-attach them together. So now it's much stronger, but only because I myself did it. Also before buying this dish, think about if you want to use grinds on it, because I now know that it is not an easy task finding the same size grinds and degrees as other size beauty dishes. All and all this is a good alternative to the other expensive dishes out there and it is also very versatile due to the ability to change the mounts you can use with it. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the price vs. the same size model they sell for $90, and if the price reflects the add on of the speedlight bracket mount then they need to improve the mount to justify the price. The time and effort it can take to ensure that you have a secure hold is unnecessary. Also I'm sure over time the brackets ball joint will loss its hold the more you use it."

I wish these were just a bit bigger for him as they just barely fit. They are a slimmer type fit which is good for some people but for my son they were a bit narrow. Definitely order a size larger and you should be just fine. From what I saw, size 5 was the largest size available for me to order so that is why I choose size 5.

14363,__label2__,2,Y,Beauty,B00AI0W3VQ,Lumene Finland Illuminating Anti-Age BB Cream 02 Medium,A Bit Disappointing........ See Photos ~,"I ordered this product based on the reviews but was pretty disappointed. I tried it on as soon as it arrived and was excited because I've tried so many different BB creams and this one was said to be the best... I spent 10+ years as a beauty consultant and have tried various foundations and BB and CC creams, expensive and inexpensive. Sadly, I didn't think this was even mediocre.<|SEP|><|SEP|>I rated it 2 stars because some of the ingredients have good skin benefits and it smells great and was packaged nicely. Lol, that's all I really liked about it. Well, and the price of course but it was money wasted because I won't likely wear it!<|SEP|><|SEP|>The 02 Medium was quite orange on me. I'm of Southeastern descent, for reference, I have a bit of an olive undertone and usually wear medium beige tones... This color would match well on someone who has done a good share of fake tanning.... Noticeably orange.<|SEP|><|SEP|>I have combination oily skin. Slightly oily in the T-zone and normal everywhere else. For me, this product went on too dry. Maybe because of the SPF but so dry, it was difficult to blend. Being that the color was dark for my skin, I warmed it up in my fingers to apply it thinly but still it didn't apply evenly.<|SEP|><|SEP|>My biggest gripe was that I was wearing a white tee and quickly found that it doesn't set well. It rubs right off with hugs, drips off if sweaty, and just didn't have any staying power. I hadn't used my usual setting spray or any powder though because I quickly found this product disappointing and decided to not spend more time on it.<|SEP|><|SEP|>It did cover well without using too much product but as said, was too dry for my liking. It made my skin feel nicely tightened though and maybe with more use would have more benefits but I'm not feeling led to buy more in a lighter color.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Since initially trying it, I've gotten more sun and developed a nicer tan. I tried this again but the hue was still just too orange. I'd use it under my eyes for concealing dark circles if it had better staying power.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Uploaded some photos for reference. Unfortunately, for me, this product is not a keeper. Hopefully this might help someone. Wish it worked better!"

You would think that the free weight room would be the most dangerous part of the gym. Not in my experience. The handball/racquetball courts present the most injuries. Followed by face plants on treadmills. While broken resistance bands don't usually result in a serious injury, they do break. The potential for getting slapped in the face or eye is a real threat. One reason resistance bands break is because they get stretched too far. This SPRI Braided Xertube is extra long. Thus allowing most users to engage in exercises with full range of motion without stressing the rubber in this resistance band. The braided tubing is firmly anchored into the handles. This product will meet the needs of a taller person with long arms/legs seeking increased resistance."

I have done some research into lead in cookware and have found it is not a danger in cast iron. Based on my reading I find that in stoneware it can be a problem.

18590,__label2__,5,Y,Health & Personal Care,B0021LL1MM,Swissco Bath and Spa Pillow with Suction Cups,Great for lying down in the bath; leaks air and gets moldy after a while.,"This pillow does what I expect. It keeps my back warm when I recline on it, and keeps my head above water when I use it flat on my back. It is just the right size to be comfortable under the neck with no straining. I will say that it is just a tad narrow. It definitely does not span from shoulder to shoulder. So to protect your back from a freezing cold tub back, you will need to position it very strategically. Overall, though, this was a good purchase. Update 1+ years later: The pillow has developed a few drawbacks over time. First, it started leaking, which means it constantly fizzles and sputters air out when you're leaning on it. This can range from insignificant annoyance to major detractor from how relaxing your bath is. Second, the pillow's exterior is very susceptible to growing bath mold. If you let this get bad, you will not want to use it in your bath again. I literally have had pieces of mold flaking off and floating in the tub with me while using this pillow. I've tried soaking it in a vinegar solution, and I've tried spraying it with anti mildew spray and scrubbing it with a plastic bristle brush. Nothing seems to keep it clean anymore. I didn't buy this pillow intending it to have a useful life of only about a year. But that's about what I got. After that, you'd better have been cleaning it routinely, because otherwise, it gets *funky*. Your mileage may vary."

The Penguin is a slightly sympathetic but in general evil and sadistic. I love Michelle Pfeiffer's portrayal of Catwoman. She is both a good guy and a bad guy and not very manipulative. I love because she is a complete b**ch, but in a good way. No one pushes her around and those that do she gets even with. Although she and Batman do start a relationship she can't deny who she truly is and she would rather be that than be with him. The Penguin gets his comeuppance. Selena gets even with Max who pushed her out of the window.

12861,__label2__,4,N,Home Improvement,B00RZUBJZI,"SentrySafe SFW123BSC Fingerprint Safe, X-Large","Agent 007 just logging in to grab some books... Fingerprint scanner is VERY convenient, yet NO INSTRUCTIONS!","[[VIDEOID:aab1293d5ebb90e2bbcb409ca4122c02]]Ok, I'm really surprised the main selling point for this safe is the fingerprint scanner, yet the instruction manual included in this one has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING written about that feature!! I mean, the manual itself is a generic one that tries to cover different models including the ones with a dial (which this model does not even have). Luckily, I searched the internet and found one explaining for a different safe/model... (I mean if they have it explained for a different biometric model, why didn't they update/include a manual for this safe?) To program your fingerprint(s): ------------ you need to press the ""P"" (program) button and then enter the 5-digit FACTORY code (located on the back of your manual) The sensor should be blinking Make sure you peel the cover on the scanner and then swipe your finger in a downward direction over When you get multiple successful reads (you must do it several times) then the green light will flash three times To delete a user fingerprint, press the ""P"" button, enter 5 digit facory code, and then press ""C"" (CLEAR). You can program 2 fingerprints. ------------ * There is a factory 5-digit code located on the back of the included manual - THIS CODE CANNOT BE CHANGED OR DELETED - what you get is what you get! * You can program/add 2 additional user codes * You get 2 physical keys, which is ONLY for double-security to prevent the safe from opening even if you enter the correct key code; before I received and saw there was a keyhole to this safe, I thought the keys were another way to open the safe/override the keypad, but that's NOT what it does. Therefore, I just leave the key turned to unlock side. * Replacing batteries is really easy - it just slides out located behind the keypad (this can also be a con!). It takes 4 AAA batteries. * The sound of the buttons remind me of a microwave sounds - it can be turned off if you wish (The manual says to press 0, P, and 1 to turn off the sound and 0, P, 2 to turn it on -- after several tries I was able to turn it on/off once, but I can't seem to consistently do that right away; I'm wondering if entering the factory code prior to pressing those buttons are required or not... I wish it can be more consistent or the manual to be more clear about that) * If you enter an incorrect code 3 times in a row then it will enter DELAY mode and you'll be locked out for 2 minutes. Pros - Fingerprint scanner makes accessing/unlocking very fast and convenient (your mileage may vary depending on your fingers/sweat/etc); I thought it would be a gimmicky feature, but I really LOVE having this! It's very high-tech and cool. It totally beats having to turn the dial on my other safe - having the fingerprint scanner makes storing and removing things frequently possible. - Cool blue keypad lights; I feel like a secret agent along with the fingerprint scanner. (Red led to indicate access denial and green for granted) - Sound can be activated/deactivated - This one does come with built-in LED lights inside the door, so it lights up the inside when you open it (you can program the duration to 30 seconds, 60 seconds, or completely off) - both the LED lights on the keypad and inside makes accessing this safe possible even at night/in the dark! There's no way I can open my other safe with the dial unless the room is lit. - 4 AAA batteries easily removable (manual says they're not included, but there were already 4 of them in mine) -- however, this can also be a con! Cons: - Mine came with a huge dent on the back (I actually noticed my other SentrySafe with the dial also had a dent too); I'm surprised something that feels/look this solid can have a large dent like it got crushed by some massive hit. It seems other reviews share the same issue whether from during shipping or from the manufacture. - If someone was around and wanted to mess with you, they could remove the battery compartment and you would belocked out of your own safe! - Of course with anything digital, there is a greater risk if it fails (although I totally love the convenience of keypad/scanner than having to turn the dial clockwise/counter clockwise) I thought the included physical keys were for override, but again, it is just for extra locking. - This safe should be called Medium size, but the company refers it as X-Large. They refer to their actual large size as 2X-Large. I also own and reviewed the SentrySafe SFW205CWB Water-Resistant Combination Safe, 2X-Large; that one is a dial only and weighs a TON! I wouldn't worry about that one being walked away by anyone. This safe being ""X-Large"" size is a bit more manageable and a more ideal size; two adults can definitely pick it up and walk away with it. I suppose a heavy lifter can lift this alone, but it is heavy. I definitely prefer this X-Large size and fingerprint scanner/keypad a lot more than the combination dial; they both have their advantages/disadvantages, but for fast convenience and cool factor, this safe wins."

One year I ended up with some sort of tarp that we ended up using for our barbecue because no one claimed it. The Classic cover is going nowhere fast and has a lot of great qualities that make it worth while for anyone with a built-in barbecue to invest in. We don’t have a built-in, but still can use the cover.<|SEP|><|SEP|>What’s great about it are the two Velcro straps beneath the cover that will secure it to the barbecue. Along the edges the material is elasticized, another factor that will keep it from flying away. If it does, the barbecue will have to go with it because it’s that secure. The cover itself is a thick, sturdy 100% woven polyester with a rubberized lining. This is the type of polyester that I see in backpacks an luggage.<|SEP|><|SEP|>There are even some gussets with small circles that will help keep the Classic cover in place when there are heavy gusts of wind. We do have those and that’s when we sometimes find an odd assortment of things in our yard. The gussets will divert those gusts, keeping them from pulling the cover up into the air. The cover will not only protect the barbecue from the elements, but make it easier to clean.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The cover is water-resistant and very well-sewn and designed. Installation, if you want to call it that, only takes a minute and is intuitive. This is nothing like those cheap, lightweight tarps that blow away, tear, or get holes in them quickly. It would take a long time to get any wear on this tarp from putting it on and off. This is definitely a sturdy, well-made tarp that will protect a barbecue."

I keep it inside my backpack in a pocket that keeps it from opening, and it's been great in that capacity.<|SEP|><|SEP|>So, the case is sturdy and very crush resistant, and good for tossing in your bag or car door, but the poor closing mechanism means you shouldn't expose it to situations where that might be an issue."

They LOVE (and I mean absolutely without a doubt love) this Jeep more than anything else they have ever played with!<|SEP|><|SEP|>The 6-year-old actually helped put it together (the directions were very easy to follow!) though I suggest using a power screw driver. That would have made the assembly much quicker- there are tons of screws used to put it together! It's helpful to have two people to put it together but not absolutely necessary. This is something to consider if you're planning on assembling this Christmas Eve.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The 6-year-old is a tall 49&#34; but has no problem fitting in the jeep and he learned very quickly how to switch gears between fast, slow and reverse. His brothers (4 and 2) take turns riding as passengers. The middle one can drive it but he's not as confident and savvy as his older brother so he hasn't done much driving yet- he's content to just ride.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The charging process isn't bad at all. You leave the battery in the jeep and unplug the Jeep's power plug and then attach the wall charger plug with the battery still in the jeep. Makes it very easy. We just leave it in the garage and plug it in after every use like they suggest. It runs out of juice after about 1 1/2 -2 hours of constant high-speed driving. I'm actually happy that it requires charging time though or the boys would never want to do anything else.<|SEP|><|SEP|>There's a little battery powered radio that plays music with real buttons to push. My little boys love that feature, especially as passengers. It requires AA batteries that aren't included.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The Jeep maneuvers very well on the sidewalks and on concrete. It has to work a little harder going through grass but still works okay going up small hills around our neighborhood. One drawback is that it is pretty loud andas the boys want to get out and play as soon as they wake up in the morning I worry that they're waking my neighbors up. No complaints yet though!<|SEP|><|SEP|>After about 3 weeks of daily riding it is still in great shape! With 3 boys that is a huge positive in my book and kind of surprising.

I don't know how long the batteries will last, but it is so much better than the wind up kind I don't care. It was easy to install on the crib and is very secure. I wish there were more volume settings (it has two). Even on the loudest setting it is kinda quiet. I would definitely purchase this mobile again or buy it for other future mothers for a shower gift.

All but one of their recommendations includes both cover art and a full page of the comic for the reader to consider. If the series or graphic novel has won awards these are noted next before topics of an educational nature are listed along with a rare website that expands upon these often very basic life lessons. ""Heads Up"" lists some issues that might concern some parents like name calling or violence or potty humor for example. ""What's Next..."" suggests other comic books or graphic novels that touch upon the same themes or use the same genre.<|SEP|><|SEP|>I was pleasantly surprised at the wide range of genres and the quality of artistry included in this guide. Indeed the range is so great that I was surprised that some of these comic books or graphic novels were appropriate for this age range. For example the ""My Boyfriend is a Monster"" series seem more for 9+ grade than 6-8 to me but perhaps we are pushing our girls to think about dating at earlier and earlier ages. Likewise ""Bone"" was a shocker to see in these pages since we've always considered this a high school or adult graphic novel around my house.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Regardless Robins and Wildsmith give us enough information to make an informed decision before we buy any of these for our children or children we know. I can't say this is worth buying given how many new comic books and graphic novels can come out every year but you should definitely borrow it from the library and check it out before you pop into your local comic book shop and buy something for a child in your life."

But be sure you fully charge before use.,"This is probably one of the most exciting gifts you can give to a young child. Most kids are fascinated with the concept of driving. So having a little vehicle they can safely maneuver is awesome. We purchased this type of vehicle for all 3 of my kids. Everyone of them was thrilled. In fact, we parked them inside the garage facing forward as though they were &#34;parked&#34;.<|SEP|>This one sits a little high, so the child has to climb up to get on it. But they won't mind.<|SEP|>I would highly recommend elbow pads and a helmet. Though we've not seen our 4 wheeler turn over on us yet, but there were a couple of times going over some big bumps on the hilly areas that it looked as though it might tip. So steer your kids away from really bumpy areas and stay on mostly level ground. This is not a TRUE 4 wheeler. It is not designed for rough terrain. It is a TOY.<|SEP|>When it first arrives at your house, it might be best not to let the little ones know it's there. It has to be partly assembled and charge overnight (you have to plug it in) before it can be used. If you charge it less than the recommended time, the battery will never hold a charge for long.<|SEP|>Being that it runs on an oversize battery, it's only good for about 20 minutes of constant riding before it starts to lose some power."

10885,__label2__,5,N,Video DVD,B000J103PC,The Devil Wears Prada (Widescreen Edition),"Oh, I'm sorry, do you have some prior committment? Some hideous skirt convention you have to go to?","Pound for pound, no one lays on the vicious snark like a woman targeting another woman. THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA explores a corner of the cutthroat fashion industry, a nerve-wracking environment replete with competitive jealousies and general, all-around meanspiritedness. Into this world steps Anne Hathaway's character, Andrea ""Andy"" Sachs, an aspiring journalist eager to get a foot in the door. To gain invaluable experience, Andy interviews for a job as the assistant's assistant to the ridiculously demanding Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), acclaimed head of the trend-setting Runway magazine.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Andy is a size six, and this automatically makes her the brunt of mean jokes by those in her new work office. Andy comes from a down-to-earth place and sort of scoffs at her co-workers' unending obsession with haute couture. She promises her boyfriend cook Nate (Adrian Grenier) that she won't change. But of course she does. Andy loses her way.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Meryl Streep submits yet another powerhouse performance as the film's dragon lady. Miranda Priestly is the sort of boss who can effortlessly, whimsically shatter an employee's self-esteem. I take in the twitchy reactions of those in her circle and how they tiptoe on eggshells whenever she's in the room, and even I start to sweat. But Meryl Streep is able to sneak in an echo of vulnerability. You may end up sympathizing with her a bit. This actress is just so consistently good.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Stanley Tucci himself is masterful in another of his side character roles. I think every movie should have Stanley Tucci in it. Emily Blunt as Miranda Priestly's frazzled first assistant - and Andy's primary foil - is fun to watch, and she makes the most out of her thankless role. When THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA first released in 2006, Anne Hathaway was only then just starting to distance herself from her wholesome teen princess roles. So she was a question mark, going into this film, even with HAVOC and BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN in her rearview.No worries, she confidently steps into this post-Disney role, and she's quite good.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Because there's something innately appealing about Hathaway. Even when her character does eventually sell out, you don't hate her. You're not mad-dogging her. You just want her to get back on track. The film easily develops a rooting interest for her. Her immediate boss, the first assistant, is so cruddy in her behavior towards Andy that Andy right away falls into that underdog slot. Except she overcomes that soon enough. Andy, who is brainy enough that she rejected Stanford Law to pursue her journalistic dreams, turns out to be endlessly resourceful in meeting Miranda Priestly's incessant, impossible demands. It's not too long before the first assistant is demoted. Yay for Andy. You could feel her getting more and more sucked into this seductive world. Her long-suffering boyfriend's patience is wearing thin.<|SEP|><|SEP|>This film renders me a stranger in a strange land, forced to absorb exotic name brands like Prada, Valentino Garavani, Giorgio Armani, and others I would have to look up on Wiki. I desperately longed for someone to name drop the Gap or Old Navy or Fruit of the Loom, something familiar. Gratifyingly, the story drew me in. The acting fixated me to the screen. I laughed at the right bits and scornfully rolled my eyes at the sheer fanaticism these frantic characters invested in mere articles of clothing. I then went to sleep in my awesome grown-up Underoos."

What a cleaver way to manage drops!! You just need to understand how to use it. One tip I can tell you is this: while dropping, try to keep the bottle in a straight vertical position (South direction or 270 degree). Do not tilt it. Do not shake it. Just keep it in this position and patiently wait for the drop to gradually falls. Also, do not hold the baby's mouth until you actually see the drop &#34;about&#34; to come off. Practice a few times and you will catch the right timing as when to hold your baby's mouth so the baby won't get frustrated from holding her/his mouth for longer time.<|SEP|><|SEP|>A great product!!

Lonely Planet really gets into a country in their guides. The don't fill their pages with glossy color photos, though a few would be nice, instead their pages are full of information.<|SEP|><|SEP|>They have maps to everywhere you'd want to go in a country. They do the cities justice as well as the countryside. They do the markets and the beaches, the churches and the museums, the bike trails and the footpaths.<|SEP|><|SEP|>I believe a trip to Thailand should include a side tour to Vietnam, at least mine is going to, so both books are a necessity to me. The book on Thailand is over 800 pages and its writers write as if they've lived there, as if they really know the country. A different group of writers have written the Vietnam book and that surprised me, because I though some of them would have worked on both books. Nevertheless, though it's 250 pages shorter than the Thailand book, the book on Vietnam is equally as well written.<|SEP|><|SEP|>I should say that the print in these books is on the smallish side, but I suppose to make it any larger they'd have to have so many pagers that the books would be unwieldy, especially the Thailand book.<|SEP|><|SEP|>I've always looked at Lonely Planet as catering to a different kind of clientele than Frommor's or Fodor's. Those two companies seem to cater more toward the traveler who has more to spend, who will more than likely stay in the more expensive hotels. Sure you'll find the expensive hotels in Lonely Planet as well, but you'll find a myriad of less expensive alternatives. I believe you get more information about a country from Lonely Planet and I'm looking forward to going to Thailand and Vietnam and having Lonely Planet show me the way."

11978,__label2__,5,Y,PC,B00IDWFN4U,Corsair Raptor M45-5000 DPI Optical Sensor Gaming Mouse (Raptor M45),Great mouse with a couple caveats.,"What a beautiful mouse. Has everything you will ever need for the average user. This isn't an MMO mouse or anything so don't expect myriad buttons and access to those kinds of features. It does have an extensive macro system though, and the features on the new firmware are pretty decent for this price range. At any rate mouse enthusiasts usually know what their mouses are for. The side pads as many have said have a sweet feeling sandpaper-like compound... BUT this doesn't last as long as one would like for the thumb position IF you use the mouse a lot. MANY mice today use that decrepit shiny and sticky plastic for where your thumb/pinky finger goes... The feeling after this compound wears down is akin to a slightly stickier plastic. The plastic itself is hard enough so the feeling is never too annoying; I must stress how important this is, because a soft and sticky plastic for my thumb and other fingers will have me wanting to throw the mouse away nearly immediately. I wish the normal sandpaper feel had been able to keep itself for at least 6 months. But this is still much better than my last mouse in feel and touch. I love the overall design of it. I'm just grateful they didn't go with that nasty, shiny stuff CM used on my Havoc. Anyway, I updated firmware and installed software in 2 minutes. While not quite the extensive system of options that CM has, this mouse for the time being has topped my old Havoc which had the aforementioned sticky plastic problem requiring tape. Otherwise I think CM's software is better and allows a lot more functionality with LEDs and a couple other things. What is there is pretty decent and you can tune each axis on the pad and have three different slots for DPI, easily reachable below the scroll wheel. A single, small and red LED light is for the first slot and this goes to three lights. They are pretty low key and not too bright. I shut off the Corsair logo as it was too bright and annoying for my tastes. I am not sure what thenative specs are on the DPI sensor but I use about 900-1200 on my desktop and it feels about perfect. I certainly don't need much higher. My PC gaming is mostly done with a controller, but scrolling and clicking buttons works great for the games that need it. As with every mouse make sure it fits your hand. I feel I can put my palm into if I want or just basically finger touch it and the control and ease with how this mouse glides makes mousing fun again (I have been using some dimestore version for the past 10 days). They have a nice supplement of weights if you choose to lower what they have at the factory. I don't mind it right out of the box. Others will want to take a weight or two out. The roller is also topnotch here and has a metal and rubber design. Still working great after a year of solid work. The materials have held fairly well over this time and I am completely satisfied with the mouse. All in all a homerun for the M45."

First off I will give it some credit for actually allowing the ac adapter to plug in snug. However after that is out of the way there are several fatal problems with this for the HP dv3-2155mx. The first and most obvious is that the white connector is not sized appropriately to fit within the slot in the computer. The second is a combination of its length and ferrite along the cable. The housing inside the laptop is not full of extra space and certainly the total length of this cable and that ferrite don't help anything. The last and most subtle problem with this fit is that the end with the jack has a bunch of wires which do not allow the left speaker to fit correctly after installation.<|SEP|><|SEP|>My DIY fix for this was to cannibalize the one part that I wanted (the jack) and solder the old connector back on this after I removed the unnecessary shrink fit and bent the terminals to allow for the clearance for the speaker.<|SEP|><|SEP|>I would pay $5 or $10 more for a cable that was correct from the get go. Don't buy this unless you have a good soldering iron and adequate patience for this sort of thing.

I live in NYC and we have had 2 snow/ice storms since I got it so I've been able to try it out twice. I really like the squeegee side, which I used both to push heavy snow off the car and to clear snow from my windows. The brush is pretty good too, makes it easier to break apart the snow stuck to the car. The scraper is EXCELLENT. Probably the best scraper I have used. It easily scraped the ice of my windshield and windows with ease.<|SEP|><|SEP|>I took off one star because I did have some issues with this snow broom. First, I wish the brush head was wider. At only a little over 7&#34; wide, you have to make several passes get the snow off sections of your car. Second, the brush head and the scraper are not level on mine, which gets annoying when I have to rotate it when I flip it over to use the other side. It doesn't lay flat because if the brush is flat on the ground the scraper is turned about 45 degrees, so it balances on it's edge. Also, the soft cushion grip slides, especially when the metal handle is really cold.<|SEP|><|SEP|>For the $5 price it is excellent. I wouldn't pay more than that for it. My 10&#34; snow broom was only $10, and that clears the car much quicker, but doesn't have a squeegee and the scraper is not as good.

I'm sorry Hydro Flask, I can't support your logo, but I will always buy your flip-top lids b/c they are truly leak proof. Also the gasket comes off if you want it to, so you can periodically soak it in vinegar or whatever to make sure it stays un-moldy. Edit: I am surprised to read another reviewer describing their experience with the lid breaking quickly. This is b/c I put smoothies in my thermos and forget to clean the remainder out right away and the pressure builds as it ferments and I can't screw the cap off. So then I open the little flip-part and use it as my lever to apply pressure to as I'm screwing the lid open and I always think I'm going to snap it off but I never do. I've done it a million times. Of course I'm no muscular powerhouse. But I have to say that I've specifically been impressed by how resistant to breakage that flip top is, given that I am applying pressure directly to its weakest point, the hinge, as I twist. So take this embarrassing story about my tendency to ferment leftover smoothie as a testimony to the flip lid's strength. Unless you're one of those guys who accidentally snaps the handles off the washing machine and stuff like that. In that case, you are simply a danger to plastic and no lid is going to survive the terror of your reign. Why manufacturers are still designing leaking lids after someone figured out how to make a leak proof one is beyond me. Only 1/100 mugs have leak-proof lids. How does that make any sense? You can't tell me that the leaky lids are significantly more ergonomic to drink from, or easier on the eyes. Are you guys just doing this to screw with us?

Single player starts off ok before devolving into a check the block COD knock off. The arrest mechanic, while fun at first, gets repetitive since bad guys react the same way every time. AI is just awful. But hey, who plays battlefield for single player, right? Hotwire and heist multiplayer modes are great. Conquest mode is neutered without attack helicopters and tanks. Sure it's a cops and robbers game, but if you are going to throw in a classic mode than Visceral/DICE shouldn't have been so lazy about it. They could have themed it to allow for the fun stuff. After all, they have tanks and attack choppers in the campaign. The few 5v5 modes are not worth your time as Counter-strike does them better. There are a few balancing issues and bugs that need to be ironed out, but overall it runs well. There is hardly any destruction outside of levolution events, which kind of makes sense so that people may use the grappling hook and a few other gadgets, but it's still a disappointment none the less. My biggest gripe is the overall lack of content. EA promised us that Hardline would have the same amount of content as BF4. That was a lie. You only get a few guns per class. Take the enforcer class for example, you get to choose between 2 shotguns or 2 medium range rifles. If you don't like any of those then you are sh$% out of luck. Same thing goes for pistols and for some reason they are locked to certain classes. Why can't I carry a Beretta or glock in the mechanic class? It seems to me like they stripped a lot of content to later sell as DLC, which is what this game should have been... themed DLC. While I cannot recommend at full price, I do recommend it if you can get it for $30 or less. Or just skip it all together since BF4 is running great and better titles are coming out this year. At full price - 2.5/5 stars."

10660,__label2__,5,N,Musical Instruments,B00DZW1CDO,"Ernie Ball MVP, Most Valuable Pedal",Very Well Made / More Expressive Options Than a Fixed Sweep Pedal,"There are a number of models in Ernie Ball’s pedal series with different features and Amazon will often combine reviews, which (IMO) can be confusing. To be clear, I’m talking about the MVP 6162 – the straight mono volume pedal plus a tuner jack. There’s no stereo pan functionality and, although the instruction sheet doesn’t specify, based on performance it’s a good bet the pedal uses a 250k audio-taper pot similar to the 6166 and 6180 models – best suited for passive guitar and bass pickups. I don't usually comment on other reviews but incorrect info shouldn't go unchallenged when it can mislead people. Anyone who says this pedal won't fully cut off volume is wrong or isn’t using it correctly: There are minimum and maximum sweep knobs and turning the minimum knob fully counter-clockwise gives you a heel position that fully cuts off volume (or as fully as turning down the volume pot on your instrument will – I’m not talking scientific detection of incidental line noise/interference here - just practical 'off'). The minimum knob also allows you to set the lower volume ‘floor’ – meaning if you don’t want to fully cut off volume you can maintain some level at the pedal’s full-heel position. Why might you want to do this? Consistency for one: In a dynamic playing context, you may not have time to tweak the pedal position just so. Quickly going full-heel, confident you’re at the level you want, can be a real convenience (and your sound person/recording engineer will thank you – even if it’s yourself). At the other end the maximum knob is somewhat more intuitive: it allows you to set the toe-full-down maximum volume. By experimenting with min and max settings you can vary the sweep from heel to toe along with the absolute floor and ceiling volume. If you’ve only used a volume pedal with a single fixed sweep – and you wished for either a ‘tighter’ or more-gradual swell, the MVP will provide some useful and possibly more expressive and comfortable options. In case you’re wondering, turning both the max and min knobs fully down does not give you an ‘anti-volume’ pedal with zero sound, it sets a fairly wide sweep from full off to a relatively low-level maximum. I got the MVP to replace my trusty-but-scratchy 40+ year-old DeArmond pedal I've had since I discovered as a kid in the 70's that Steve Howe used one. I'm a lefty and lefty instruments were rare and pricey so I converted my own guitars, leaving the knobs on the right-hand side. Because of that I could never manage that Roy Buchanan pinky-twist move with the volume pot and needed a pedal to get 'violin' tones and textures (the EBow was still a couple of years away). Speaking of comfort, the MVP toe-down position lies parallel to the floor while the DeArmond has a 15-20 degree angle that I always found easy on my ankle – especially if I’m doing a lot of fast movements. It wouldn’t be hard to devise a large wooden shim for the MVP if you feel the same way. The MVP pedal action is much tighter compared to the DeArmond and I prefer that because it makes fine control easier (no doubt decades of use have loosened up the DeArmond but even in its prime I remember wishing it were a little stiffer). One thing the DeArmond has that the MVP doesn’t is a side-to-side tone pot function – granted it’s cheesy and will cost you even more in tone than the volume pot itself does, but it’s there. Speaking of impact on pure signal, I couldn’t detect much loss with the MVP – although as always, the longer your cables the more potential degradation. The MVP’s 3/16” brushed aluminum casing is rugged, has nice mass to sit tight without being excessively heavy, and looks great. The flat, rubberized foot surface has nice ‘tooth’ to it that’s comfortable to use wearing shoes or not. The min/max knobs are heavy metal (no pun intended) and have solid turn ratios. I wish the battery door were metal rather than plastic but I like that it’s hinged otherwise it would just scream ‘lose me!’. The battery sits close to the surface and is easy to fish in and out. The review pedal didn’t come with a power supply but I prefer batteries when recording - power supplies can add noise especially at low levels. If I were back in my club-gig days, tossing equipment in and out of dark trunks, I might question the open access to the pedal’s internal components under the foot control – too easy to get picks and other small items stuck in there and it could be a pain to shake them out. I can’t comment on the tuner jack function (I’m old school tuning fork and ears). Bottom Line: The MVP makes for a more flexible-functioning and quieter volume pedal than traditional fixed sweep pedals. And in this age of ever-thinner plastics the top-notch workmanship is much appreciated. I’ll still keep my DeArmond for sentimental reasons but the MVP will surely be my go-to volume pedal from now on."

15979,__label2__,5,N,Books,1439198950,To the Last Breath: A Memoir of Going to Extremes,Inspirational,"One man's journey to conquer the physical becomes his emotional deliverance. Francis Slakey begins his quest with a goal in mind - set a record, to be the first man to climb the highest mountain on every continent and to surf every ocean. The challenge he sets out in front of him seems simple at the time: 8 peaks, 4 shorelines, 12 experiences to check off his To Do List. He is driven by his indifference to the world to shrug it off in this independent series of adventures. The world, as it turns out, would have none of that.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Slakey is brutally honest about his own agenda, and about how he failed others in following it. At first he failed others, that is. But as he slowly began to open himself up to the amazing experiences surrounding him at every turn, his agenda changed. He changed. He found that it was possible to evolve from someone serving himself to someone serving others. And he didn't do it with a mushy gushy love story, although love was present. He did it by finding that man within himself, the one that always existed. Just as he encourages us to do, simply by telling his story.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Inspirational and exciting, follow Francis Slakey as he scales mountains, crosses plains of ice, hunkers down during blizzards, and dodges bullets in an around-the-world adventure that is like none the average joe will ever have. Slakey shares with us his most amazing experiences and his darkest moments and through it all we discover a man we can all learn from. Read it for the adventure, sure, but take away from it the perspective.<|SEP|><|SEP|>I received this book for free through the Goodreads First Reads program."

I bought one right before a trip and was loving it until 2/3 of the digitizer went intermittent then quit working. After looking at it under various lighting conditions while it was off, I could see a hair line crack in the display/digitzer stack. The fracture was not visible with the display on. You could not feel it on the surface. The digitizer worked on the narrow side of the crack and not on the other two thirds of the screen.<|SEP|>This device is too fragile. The chassis flexes easily and I believe this is what allows the display to flex enough to break the digitizer. I feel like this product is going to have major issues because it is small enough to fit in a pocket like a large cell phone and based on the amount of flex in the chassis, this is the kiss of death for a nexus 7. For anyone considering buying a 2013 Nexus 7, put it in a nice fat rigid case immediately and never, never subject it to any flex.<|SEP|><|SEP|>I think Asus should take a look at an a Samsung note 2. I have carried one for a year and not been nearly as careful, and it is holding up fine, granted it is smaller, but the 2013 nexus 7 lasted 3 days and the repair cost (165.00 for a screen that you install) The repair cost is too expensive to make sense and turns an awesome device into land fill fodder. What sucks is that I feel responsible for breaking it although it was never dropped or handled roughly, and from the posts around the web, I can tell that it is a waste of time to try to get Asus to stand behind their product even though it is three days old.<|SEP|><|SEP|>As much as I hate to sound like a Apple fan boy, at least you can fix an ipad digitizer for 30 bucks if you are willing to burn an hour or two.

I did a lot of research before buying this model, so I was aware of most of it's shortcomings before purchase. There were some questions I had that I could not find answers for, so I thought I would write a review so I can answer these questions for other people.<|SEP|><|SEP|>If you have a DualShock 4 controller (PS4 controller) you can pair it to the TV. Their primary reason is for Playstation Now, but the controller can also be used for any of the other Android apps you load on the TV.<|SEP|><|SEP|>It has the Google Play store, and you're not limited to a handpicked selection from Sony. I was able to load a Super Nintendo emulator onto this TV. I was also able to put an app called Moonlight on here which allows me to stream my desktop PC games to this TV from across the house (needs Nvidia GPU).<|SEP|><|SEP|>It has Netflix, Amazon VOD, and Youtube built in, which is nice since I don't need to use my Roku anymore! You can also download Plex, Kodi, or Hulu Plus from the Google Play Store.<|SEP|><|SEP|>This TV isn't perfect. It does not come with 3D glasses and they are actually kind of hard to find and the Play Store was a little slow loading for me on occasion.<|SEP|><|SEP|>I wish the price didn't jump from $798 up to $1299 for just 5&#34; more, but it's still a great value. As long as you have read the reviews on here and are aware of some of the minor problems beforehand I think you will enjoy this TV a lot."

That's when he suggested I try I vacuum specifically designed for ash and debris pickup. After some research I came across the Bad Ash 2. I tried it and it did an excellent job.

16348,__label2__,4,N,Video Games,B007XVTR3K,Call of Duty: Black Ops II - Xbox 360,Competitive for the Better,"Alright everybody knows what Call of Duty is really about and that is multiplayer. It is Treyarch's bread and butter and it makes people keep coming back for more. Yes there is zombies and campaign but multiplayer caters to most CoD fans out there so this review will be multiplayer biased. I can say that zombies are fun based on experience but I cannot say the same for the campaign for those interested.<|SEP|><|SEP|>There is a new pick ten system which allows people to build a class catering to their play style. Personally I like this new approach as it allow me to play the way I want without certain in game limits. There is also a new mode called league play which puts players of equal ability next to each other. I really liked this because I would consistently get chopper gunners and high skill steaks in older games and as fun as that sounds to people it got old really fast. I have been on the receiving end of high skill streaks too and understand that is just as good a reason to quit the game. Now by playing people of similar skill it is a challenge to win and there is a reward to keep playing the game! Additionally people who don't play as often will be placed with similar skill so there will be less frustration!<|SEP|><|SEP|>People complain a lot about hit markers and lag but that is not been a problem for me. I've seen the youtube videos and it is often an excuse for bad play. The lag is minimal in this game, if there is lag it boots the host and gets a better connection. I play with best connection on all the time, which may be the solution to the lag issue. Also realize the Cod series has been out for a while and some people are seasoned vets so I recommend league play for new players as they will get matched with other new players looking to learn the ropes of the game.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Treyarch has embraced the competitive community in this game more than ever. I like this mostly because the competitive community is likely to support the game till the end of its run. I feel as though it is unjust to ignore the competitive community when casual gamers will have likely have moved on 3 months into release. Realize too the result of competitive gaming is a more balanced and clean playing game for everyone.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Even if competitive isn't your fancy there is plenty to keep the casual gamer interested for quite a long time. 2/4 map packs have been released and zombies has been beefed up quite a bit since world at war. There is so much more to unlock and customize this time around. Say what you want about the series, but nothing still beats going into a lobby with your friends (virtual or not) and wreaking havoc on the enemy. No other FPS does that better than Call of duty black ops 2 does today.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Overall, campaign is a flop, but the zombies and multiplayer is the by far the best in the franchise."

That fact alone is my favorite feature about this camera. Granted there are tons of great features to talk about and we will get into that through this review; but I want to point out that this camera can be used for the home or business and is simple to setup. Some ideas or ways you can use this camera is as a security camera, baby monitor, intercom system, and workshop monitor. As I have mentioned this camera is easy to setup and the box includes everything you need to get going. First plug in the Ethernet and power cables, then get your phone or tablet ready. The box has three qr codes that are for the iOS and Android apps along with the camera id and password. Once you download the app all you have left to do is create an account and add the camera. To add the camera select settings option on the top right side of the app, scroll down, and press &#34;Add device.&#34; Then press the qr code button, scan the small qr code on the box or bottom of the camera, type in the password, and follow any other prompts it pops up. That's all there is too it to set it up initially. The rest of the settings are preferences such as resolution, activating alarms, and other settings such as sensitivity. Once you get all your preferences selected it's time to mess around and discover everything the camera can do. Some of the features I like the most is the rotating head that you can control from your app and the alerts. The only problem I had with the camera was not actually the camera's fault. I was not able to setup the camera using WiFi and that's because my Apple router does not have a WPS button to sync between the camera and router. However, I am able to connect the camera to my WiFi if I unplug the Ethernet cable and leave it connected to the power source. I would love to have the camera apart from my router, but until I get something else I will have to use it while tethered to the router. Other than the non-wireless setup I would like to have, there are no complaints from me at all. This is a quality IP camera that anyone can use."

You can turn the clapper 360 easily, so you can have it where it works best. However, as others have mentioned, the band is similar to a zip-tie in concept, it is only going to go on once and stay there, it is not designed to be removed without also destroying the band. Make extra sure you have it where you want it before you tighten down the band. Also, once you do have it where you want it and the band is tightened down, if you cut off the excess band, it can leave a sharp edge on the band that remains. I used a nail clipper to file this sharp edge down."

It's a specialty item, for sure, and if your kitchen is cramped and small, without a lot of room for different gadgets, this probably isn't for you. That being said, it has a small profile and is easily tucked away.<|SEP|><|SEP|>I was impressed with how sturdy this item was. Putting it together was pretty intuitive, though I did check the directions once or twice. We have solid surface granite countertops, and I was pleased with how well the suction adhered. This little gadget wasn't going anywhere while I was mincing.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Unlike the picture, you can't stick an entire carrot in the mincer and expect it to mince. (That's the only reason I knocked off a star - I feel like the picture is misleading). This thing is dependent on your strength to mince--it's not a powered item--so you have to work pretty hard to get it to mince even large pieces of carrot. It works best when you cut items into smaller pieces. And despite the fact that it's advertised as a carrot mincer, you can mince other items in here as well. I'd stick to veggies, generally."

It was easy to assemble, and powerful enough to cut fairly thick/high grass and weeds. The &#34;edger&#34; function is one of the better I've seen/used - the motor/cutter head assembly easily swivels 90 degrees, and the small wheel keeps it at just the right height for edging along the driveway and curb. About the only drawback would be the weight of this trimmer. It is well made and somewhat heavy - so, for those of you who want something light, this is not it."

It had become completely frozen, despite light use.<|SEP|><|SEP|>History: I purchased this spreader at a local Home Depot. I used it twice a year to spread fertilizer/lime on a small lawn. I stored it (empty) in my garage between uses. Within three years (about six to eight uses) the metal drive shaft (that spins the propeller) had corroded so badly in its bearing that it could not be freed with oils, solvents, etc. Even an air racket would not free it!<|SEP|><|SEP|>I thought I was buying a professional spreader that would last a lifetime but rather I had bought an expensive piece of junk.<|SEP|><|SEP|>One last failure: While the spreader was already junk, I put the spreader away in the garage - postponing throwing it out. Come spring cleanup this year - I pulled it out of the garage for trash pickup and noticed the plastic hopper have developed stress cracks and a hole. That is how poorly manufactured the plastic is. And these flaws appeared while the spreader was empty, in storage, in a well ventilated garage!<|SEP|><|SEP|>I can honestly state this is the worse piece of equipment I've ever purchased in the last twenty years. If Agri-Fab were willing to ship me a new one of these, each and every year, for life -- I'd pay the asking price. Otherwise - I'd look elsewhere.<|SEP|><|SEP|>(BTW: During its short lifetime; it worked extremely well)<|SEP|><|SEP|>Free advice to Agri-Fab: Upgrade your drive/propeller shaft to stainless steel and improve the grade of plastic you use in the hopper. Then, you'd have a true winner - everything else is well made. Also - as noted - when it worked - it spread perfectly and with ease. It is a shame these design flaws exist because when it worked, this spreader worked flawlessly.<|SEP|><|SEP|>If this review seems contradictory - it is. What you have is a near perfect spreader that suffers from a few cheap components that severely limited its lifespan."

Among the twenty experiments detailed in the instructions are a couple of crystal-growing projects, which are always fun. Perhaps the best of these is one where you grow your own ""geode"" inside an artificial plaster shell, although you will want to take you time and be sure to cast the plaster with care - it's not the most durable material. This kit stands out for the variety and breadth of experiments it offers -- it's not just another crystal-growing set, but also includes numerous gem and mineral samples and various ways of testing their composition, strength and density. The wide scope of the set is its strong point, while it loses points for the stinginess of the materials included... The samples are small, the materials not always the best. Kids who are already into rocks and science in general might be able to make better use of the activity book is they provide their own materials, particularly if they already have a stronger, higher quality magnifying glass than the one Ravensberger provides. All in all, though, this is a nice kit with some real science and decent experiments -- worth checking out!"

10931,__label2__,5,Y,Electronics,B003CP0FUU,SONOS PLAY:5 Wireless Speaker for Streaming Music (Black) (Gen 1) (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"I absolutely love this speaker, and the SONOS system.","This speaker is great, very powerful and easily loud enough for a small party outside on my patio. Eventually I plan on purchasing a second PLAY:5 to use them as a stereo pair in my bedroom, or to move into separate rooms while cleaning the house.<|SEP|><|SEP|>In regards to the SONOS system as a whole; I had initial misgivings before making the purchase, mainly due to price and the effective locking-in to the SONOS ecosystem. I have a variety of Apple products and I'd previously been quite happy using my AppleTV with AirPlay to stream music to my main audio system, but was looking for a portable speaker to use in the bedroom and outside on the patio.<|SEP|><|SEP|>I had been very tempted by some of the B&W AirPlay speakers, but I started looking at SONOS tech for the following reasons:<|SEP|><|SEP|>- AirPlay from a mobile device can only stream to a single speaker. A laptop or desktop can stream to multiple destinations, but isn't as convenient as an iPhone or iPad for music control.<|SEP|>- AirPlay is very dependent on the quality of your home WiFi network. Any interruptions or glitches in the wireless connection will cause issues with the stream.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The SONOS system sets up it's own independent WiFi network as to not be impacted by the usage of your home network. SONOS devices stream the music directly from the internet or your music library requiring only your mobile devices (Android / iOS phones and tablets) to be used for remote control.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Setup is very easy, authorization of additional devices or controllers is done by a simple button press on an existing device.<|SEP|><|SEP|>The core thing to be aware of is that for the SONOS devices to connect to the internet, one of them MUST have an Ethernet connection to your home network. All SONOS devices come with an Ethernet network port, and SONOS sells $50 the BRIDGE device specifically to perform this role if you don't already have another device in range of an Ethernet port.<|SEP|><|SEP|>In my case I purchased a PLAY:5 and a CONNECT device. The PLAY:5 is in my bedroom and the CONNECT is hooked up to my home theater receiver via a digital optical connection. The CONNECT plays the part of the BRIDGE as it is connected directly to my home network so I didn't need to purchase a BRIDGE.<|SEP|><|SEP|>I can heartily recommend the SONOS system and do so regularly to colleagues, friends, and just about anyone who'll listen."

Once it arrived my GF looked at it, played around with the different configurations and said &#34;Wow. That's a great idea.&#34; I have to agree.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Configuration 1: Cake/dessert tray/display. Keeps pastries and the like moist and fresh, and you can see them/it. The dome is large - about 4.5x10&#34;, so it will fit most cakes. Since the entire thing is clear plastic, you really don't want to slice into it. I'd suggest a cardboard disc under whatever you wish to cut.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Configuration 2: Simply remove the dome and flip over the base. Now you have a snack tray with bowl for dip. The bowl is removable so you can use your own.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Configuration 3: Same as #2, but put the dome over it. Also the most compact storage option.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Lots of uses, great for parties.

18215,__label2__,5,N,Musical Instruments,B001Q7N1Z2,First Act MX051 Guitar Stand,Solid and reliable for holding your instrument,"My brother has been playing bass guitar for the past few years and every six months or so, I see him tossing another busted stand into the trash. I asked him why he was going through them so quickly and he told me its because he keeps buying the cheap plastic kind because he thinks that's all he needs. Well after going through three of them in the span of six months, I knew I had to intervene and provide a little guidance and assistance. I did my research and found this little guitar stand not only provides an amazing amount of durability but also the best bang for your buck.<|SEP|><|SEP|>When I purchased this item, I wanted to see how strong it was. I had already visited the local music store to compare. They started at $30 and shot all the way up to $100. Now I know musicians love to display their instruments but a hundred bucks is where I draw the line. When I saw this priced at under $20, I knew that was a fair amount but it wasn't until I held it in my hands that I was convinced this was far superior to any of the others I had ever sampled. This stand is made from pure steel and not some composite aluminum material found in the department stores. It's very tough and has a good weight to it. I would feel very comfortable hanging a 10lbs+ instrument on it. I tried to bend it gently and quickly realized it would take a lot more strength than I could expend at that moment to even put a dent into it. It is extraordinarily durable and for such a low price, I was astonished. I couldn't believe my brother would spend so much money on inferior stands when a pure gem was sitting under his nose the entire time.<|SEP|><|SEP|>Musicians stress the importance of keeping their instrument in a safe and secure place when not in use and I can see why. My brother would flip out if I put his bass on his bed let alone the floor. If it wasn't in his hands it had to be on the stand. Comparing this stand to the other ones available is almost a joke. For the price, it can't be beaten. You're not only buying a solid piece of steel but also investing in the longevity of your equipment, and not to mention, this thing looks absolutely gorgeous holding up my brother's bass.<|SEP|><|SEP|>If you're thinking about buying a new instrument or just replacing your current stand, you need to purchase this product. With all of the money you've already invested into your guitar/bass you'll definitely need a quality piece of equipment to keep it safe. This should be the first, last, and only stand you'll ever need... Unless of course you've got multiple instruments. I feel much safer with this stand holding up my brother's bass than with any of the other ones out there. And for less than $20, this is the best value and ultimate compliment for your instrument."

After spending about 15 minutes listening to both, I thought the low's on this one sounded better and the headband had more padding. They sounded very warm and were great for high's and mids, but the lows were lacking and you needed to listen on full volume for them to sound good. I decided to return them and try the Sennheiser 439 but the volume was too low and that was a deal breaker. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B005N8W1TM I brought these home http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00S749IQ8 plugged them into my Nexus 7 and I couldn't believe how great they sounded. TI listened to Bob Marley Legends album and these head phones sound incredible. The bass is tight and pronounced, but not muddy like the Dr. Drye's I'm very happy with these and I'm very glad my headphone hunt is over. In summary, Pros: + Great frequency range with deep, rich bass (5 Hz to to 22,000 Hz) + Very comfortable earpads (more comfy than other more expensive headphones I've tried) + Does not make my ears sweat, even in the summer-- a very pleasant surprise + Vibrant color options/ slick design + Wires are tangle resistant (although they are &#34;spaghetti&#34; style for those who care) + Lightweight, and fairly comfortable even with long use + Aesthetically pleasing + Price is decent + Great sound quality for price Cons: - Plastic build- not cheap feeling but worth a mention - Sound isolation is average, adequate for cafes/ dorm rooms but unsuitable for city/airplane use unless you really crank the volume - Seems to be some some sound leakage at high volumes - Noise reduction, while good for supra-aural headphones, isn't as effective as its circum-aural competitors. This wasn't a big deal to me, but itmay be for some people. - Cord is a bit short (1.2 meters) for some applications (In my case, use with a desktop computer) All in all I now recommend these to all my friends http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00S749IQ8"

19490,__label2__,5,Y,Video DVD,B007OXB1GI,Private Romeo,The concept here is like that of a traditional musical or opera,"This is not actually the story of Romeo and Juliet, but is rather the story of a group of boys in a military academy and a romance between two of them, told using (mostly, but not entirely) the text of Shakespeare's play. The two lovers are NOT Romeo and Juliet; they are Sam and Glenn, who use the lines of R & J as a way of expressing their thoughts and emotions. The concept here is like that of a traditional musical or opera, in which the story is expressed through songs which aren't meant to be taken literally (that is, the characters themselves aren't really singing--the actors are singing to express the characters). Here, the actors are using the text of a Shakespeare play to tell a different story. (The ending makes it clear that it is a different story.)<|SEP|><|SEP|>The actors here are superb, and make the text come alive in a way that I've never experienced before. (And it certainly doesn't hurt that they are SO easy on the eyes!) Rather than stuffy and/or wooden delivery in affected British accents, we get line readings that sound like actual live humans speaking to each other. All of the actors had experience performing Shakespeare, although for some this was their first time doing so professionally. Hale Appleman is especially good, and should have a very successful career ahead of him.<|SEP|><|SEP|>I saw this at the Reeling film festival in Chicago a few years ago, and it was my very favorite film out of the couple dozen that I saw that year."

I started with the Jovial brand, which produced a lighter texture, more yellow in color when used in pancake batter, bread and other baked goods. I've used the Ancient Grains brand for about 3 weeks now and it doesn't have the same texture and is much denser. It's a much better price, but I probably wouldn't purchase again due to these drawbacks. Einkorn wheat in general has completely changed how we eat, previously we were 100% paleo but my husband and I can both tolerate this grain very well and it's wonderful to be able to eat things like pancakes and bread again."

I must say that chain cleaning tools have really improved over all that time. The handle on this tool really helped keep it in place while cleaning the chain. There was way less drip and mess on this tool than my old one, and it did a great job cleaning the chain. The only issue I had was, that as couple of brush bristles got caught in the chain during the procedure. I was able to pull them out without much effort. Overall, a great way to keep your chain clean. A Must Have for any serious cyclist."

Is he ever going to not answer the phone when his ex-wife calls and just forget about her? Will he be able to stop drinking? Can he keep his community happy in the small northeastern town he polices and hang onto his job? Will he ever find a woman who is sympatico?<|SEP|><|SEP|>In between battling his own demons, therapy sessions with his shrink (William Devane), and cryptic conversations with just about everybody including his dog, Jesse manages to solve quite a few crimes with his non-police manual methods.<|SEP|><|SEP|>In analyzing why this series is compelling, one reason is that it just feels real. Selleck inhabits the role of Jesse Stone with ease. You feel like he's playing some aspect of himself. The secondary characters are strong. You don't feel like you are watching a show. You feel like it's real life. And you care about the characters. Even the crooks have a sort of likability in some instances.<|SEP|><|SEP|>This is the kind of series you could watch every year. Although another show hasn't been purchased by CBS, Selleck said in an interview that he thinks someone will want to produce another episode. We hope Selleck is right. In the meantime, you can just re-watch the episodes in this complete set until they do."

I've tried several different brands and while I can't say I notice a great deal of difference in the performance of the powders--how they mix into the smoothie, how I feel after using them for a while, etc.--there IS an obvious difference in the taste. For example, while I hate to blast my beloved Trader Joe's, the taste of their brand of vanilla protein powder is astonishingly poor. If you take a taste of the Muscle Milk brand and then immediately try a bit of the Trader Joe's, it is not much of an exaggeration to say that the latter has a taste and consistency that is barely one step above sawdust (please, dear reader, note that I do not actually eat sawdust, but I am guilty of a bit of artistic license in my reviews). Other brands, while not quite THAT bad, are still way behind Muscle Milk in the taste category. This is the only brand I have found which really tastes good--like something you'd want to drink in a shake even if you DIDN'T need protein powder.<|SEP|><|SEP|>So having tried 6 or 7 brands now, I can easily say that this is not only the best tasting, but the best tasting BY FAR. Highly recommended."

16627,__label2__,1,Y,Musical Instruments,B0037M62KA,"Planet Waves Classic Leather Guitar Strap, Black",Bought one a few years ago - it was good. The latest two are awful.,"I bought one of these as a gift a few years ago and was really impressed with the quality. I bought two more of these recently, one black one brown. They are a total disappointment. Both appear to be man made material, not at all the quality of the first one I purchased. If there is any actual leather, it is a very thin layer over cheap man-made material. They not only look cheap, but they feel worse. The color is off and it doesn't even feel good for fake leather. The black one has threads hanging off of several edges that are clearly man-made (there's no stitching on these). Unfortunately I didn't inspect them when I received them, 30 days elapsed and I can't return them. They're so disappointing that I don't even want to keep them as spares no matter how little I paid for them. I hate to just throw them away, but I'd be embarrassed to give them to anyone. Original review - 1st purchase: This is a single layer fairly thick strap of sturdy leather with a suede back. At full price of 16.99, it is a solid deal. Any lower, and it is a steal. Leather straps are a little tricky to buy online; You can't feel it or see the exact one you are purchasing, and every piece of leather is different. Most of the time with leather straps, you get the quality you pay for. This one appears to be an exception to that rule. But if you are looking for buttery soft fine Corinthian leather with gold stitching, you need to understand that you'll have to pay more. If you want one made from Wild Buffalo Leather or Free Range Mastodon Hide, you'll need to hitch a ride in the Tardis. If all you want is a solid deal on a basic leather strap that won't let you down, this is a safe bet. Oh and tight strap button holes? That's a good thing in my universe, as gravity is often as irresistible as the lure of time travel (on this Planet, anyhow)."

When you unrolling the sheet from the roll it does have some wrinkles, I believe that is quite normal when it is rolled on a roll and then unrolled. It can be corrected by pilling the plastic sheet from the role and then applying back onto the sheet and smoothing out the bubbles in the process. This reflective film usually is really expensive. The small hassle of having to reapply some parts of the wrinkled sheets is a small price to pay for the incredible price you pay for the reflective room. It looks good on my pedicabs in Houston.
