He loves it and we are very happy with the quality of the wood.<br /><br />It is well made, easy to assemble, has a good amount of support on the back side so that he can use his left hand when not in direct contact with the ground.  We have also been able to get him used to using &#34;flats&#34; at home instead of having to worry about what would happen if they did not come into contact with each other.  It was delivered by UPS within 2 days!<br /><br />The metal reinforcement around the top makes it much easier to put together.  The aluminum frame allows you to make sure everything is lined up correctly.  This means that there is no need to drill holes or anything else like that.<br /><br />Overall I highly recommend this product.",NON-GUIDED
Outdoors,"We bought this for our 3 year old grandson.  He loves it so much that he uses it every day to walk on the trail.  It is very functional and easy to use.  We have not had any issues with water damage, but we are able to get him out of his car in less than an hour.<br /><br />The only thing I would like to point out is that there is no &#34;slip&#34; between the two wheels.

We are able to hold several different types of tools without having to worry about getting caught on one end or the other.  It's not too bulky, but you don't have to be very careful when using it.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because my son doesn't seem to mind if there were more tools out there that could help him with those tasks.  So far no problems at all.",NON-GUIDED
Musical Instruments,"Got this for my husband and he loves it.  He's a huge bass player, but I'm not sure if that's due to the fact that his guitar isn't as sharp or crisp as some other musicians out there have.<br /><br />I've used several of these guitars since they were first released in 1986.  They are still going strong with me playing them over and over again.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because you can't really tell which strings are which (or are not) which ones are which...<br /><br />The one thing I like most about these pickups is how good they sound.  It's very easy to set up on your amp without having to adjust the treble too much.  You don't have to worry about adjusting the treble too much at all - just know what you're doing when you turn it on/off.",NON-GUIDED

The controls are intuitive and simple to use.  There's no need to plug in extra batteries so you can adjust how well you do your instrument.  You can also turn on/off the volume knob by pressing the &#34;altitude&#34; button at the top-right of the instrument menu.  If you want to customize the tone of your instrument, then go ahead and let me know what you think :)<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that it doesn't come with an internet connection (unplugged).",NON-GUIDED

The gameplay itself is pretty much identical to Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 so you have to be careful not to get caught up in any particular plot or situation.

It doesn't seem like they will be able to tell you what you're hearing when you turn your head off if you hear footsteps.  That's not an issue as far as voice acting goes.  If you can figure out how to adjust the volume (which sounds great in his mind) then why not?  Sound effects aren't really important at all - just play music instead of playing video games.

For example, his theory of evolution dates back more than 50 million years (about 400 million years ago).

Home Entertainment,"GoingVirtually everything I was looking for in a home entertainment system.  This is my first foray into gaming.<br /><br />I have always wanted something that could capture all the attention and excitement of a home entertainment system.  The Home Entertainment System does what it's supposed to do - make your life so much more enjoyable.  It allows you to control every aspect of your home entertainment without having to worry about constantly changing settings or menus.  That being said, this device can be quite useful if you want to watch movies or other video games on your computer.  There are plenty of smart devices out there that will let you know when certain things are not up to you but also keep track of which activities are going on at any given time.  You don't have to figure out how to turn off the power button while watching Netflix or Hulu (which isn't really a big deal).",NON-GUIDED

It's not as good or better than any other series by far. There are so many twists and turns that you can't really put your finger on it unless you know exactly what you're getting at first.

Sports,"While I don't have much experience with sports, this is my first foray into gaming.<br /><br />I started out by playing games like Call of Duty and World of Tanks.  Then I decided to get into fighting games because there were so many different types of video games that I didn't want to spend a lot of money on.  This game has tons of cool graphics for it's own good but you can't really beat the action without having some fun.  There are also tons of story-based mini-marathons where you must solve puzzles in order to unlock certain secrets.  These mini-marathons give you more control over your character as well as allowing you to customize what you do instead of just throwing things at enemies.<br /><br />The gameplay itself isn't anything special either.

It was very easy to play and I enjoyed playing it as much as I did with other games.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- The controls are a bit more complex than most, so you have to figure out how to use all of the buttons in order to get at one button.<br />- There is some confusion about whether or not you need to press any of the buttons (e.g. pressing &#34;&#34;).<br />- You can select from many different menu options depending on your preference.",NON-GUIDED
Video Games,"Was this game for my 3 year old son.  He loves it so much that he was able to play it on his own without having to go through a lot of hoops.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Easy to program and plays as well as any other video game!<br />- Controls are very easy to set up, which is great if you want to learn how to program your games (e.g., jump from platform to platform).<br />- You can control several different levels by pressing the arrow keys at the top or bottom of the screen in order to move between them. The controls also allow you to adjust the amount of movement required to complete certain moves such as jumping from wall to ceiling.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- I didn't like the fact that there aren't many buttons for each character except for ""movement mode"".",NON-GUIDED

You will need to remove the handle if you don't want to be able to hold it together properly.,NON-GUIDED

It's not big enough to hold all of the tools that came with it so you don't have to worry about falling off or anything.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was due to the price and lack of quality control.  The included screw driver works just fine for what I'm looking for in a backpacking toolbox.

We got this game for our son and he loves it!<br /><br />It's pretty much everything you would expect from a video game - including the ability to play as many games as you want without having to worry about getting sick or dying.<br /><br />There are so many things I love about this game that I've never had any problem with myself before.  The first thing I did was start off by trying to figure out how to make Call of Duty: Black Ops III look like an action/adventure game.  It took me awhile to figure out how to do that because there are so many different ways to accomplish these tasks.  For example, if you need to turn up multiple times in order to complete certain missions, then each time you have to go through several levels to get access to one more level.",NON-GUIDED

It's hard to figure out how to change the oil level if you're driving under 50 miles an hour instead of 30 miles an hour.  If you want to speed up your engine (which may take some getting used to), then read the manual before changing the oil level.  You'll be fine with that; however, after reading the manual, you will need to manually adjust the amount of oil in order to get the car to turn itself upside down.",NON-GUIDED

This has led me to think that there may be some kind of defect in the rubber around the end of the strap itself which could lead to an issue with the fabric being pulled out from under the handle or something like that.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product if you are looking for quality sports products but don't want to spend your money on anything else.",NON-GUIDED

Wireless,"Weeds are great, but we had to replace the wires in order to get them back.  This was a problem for us because of our wireless network and didn't want to spend extra money on something that doesn't work as well.<br /><br />The one thing I like most about this product is its ability to charge your phone via USB instead of an ethernet cable.  That being said, it's also very easy to use when you have internet access.  If you're going to buy from Verizon or AT&T (or anywhere else) they can charge you less than 3 times the price!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product if you don't want to spend hundreds more dollars on something that does not work as well as what you pay for.",NON-GUIDED

If your child doesn't want to put it through the dishwasher they might as well just throw it on the stove top rather than at the sink.  The cookware comes with an extra 1/4&#34; plastic tray which can be removed from the dishwasher by hand if necessary.

For example, if you play in front of another person (or someone close to you) then there are no ""right"" turns at all.  This doesn't bother me as much as adjusting the position of the strings.

This is one of those things where you don't have to worry about what happens if your child gets caught up in something that doesn't even remotely happen.

Jewelry,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband and he loves it.  He loved it so much that I gave him one of his wedding rings to go with it.  It is very easy to set up, the colors are bright (blue) and there is no need to worry about anything falling off or anything being done.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was due to the price.  If you don't have any experience with jewelry stores, they will charge you an additional $10-15 if you do not have time to use your credit card before placing it on them.  The seller did send me a replacement ring in exchange for 10 more dollars ($20).",NON-GUIDED
Jewelry,"I bought this for my husband.  He loves it and has a lot of room to put his clothes back in.<br /><br />It is easy to set up, but there are no instructions on how to do that.  The only thing I would say is that you have to go through the first two steps before putting everything together.  If you don't know what else to do, make sure your hands are full when setting it up.  It took me about 30 minutes to get all the pieces together.  There were so many different ways to assemble each piece...you will need some hand tools (tools included).",NON-GUIDED

This may be due to the fact that many people don't know what they're getting at the end of the charge/discharge cycle (which usually happens between 5 - 10 minutes).<br /><br />I'm going to go ahead and say that if you want to keep your money's worth on something like this, do yourself a favor and buy one for yourself.

They are comfortable and look nice on my feet.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- The sole is made of strong polyester material (think cotton), so it doesn't make any sort of fraying around when you wear them.  It's not super tight like other soles out there in the market.  If you don't want to stretch or break your foot, then this will work just fine.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- You can't go wrong with these shoes.  Some people have complained about how small they are at their feet; others complain about how soft they feel while wearing them.

There are so many different ways to play MP3 files and convert them into VHS-like audio files.  The most common way is by downloading the file from SoundCloud (which can be downloaded directly from SoundCloud).

The screw holes are small enough to fit in our dining room window so they can easily be removed if needed.  We then used an electric drill bit to get them all out by themselves.  I didn't use any electrical tape or other means to make sure everything was centered properly.  This allowed us to move the furniture around without having to worry about what would happen next.

Video Games,"The Sims 3 are great. They have all the bells and whistles of Call of Duty: Ghosts, but they aren't as good as Call of Duty: Ghosts.<br /><br />There is a lot of replay value in this video game compared to other video games. However, it's important to note that there isn't much replay value for Call of Duty: Ghosts due to how many times you've played one or two of the series' multiplayer online co-op games. For example, if you're going to take on an armed group of soldiers at Fort Knox (or something like that), you'll end up with more replay value than any other video game.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed playing both Call of Duty: Ghosts and Call of Duty: Ghosts so far. The best part about this video game is its story.",NON-GUIDED

This worked fine for me as long as my fingers didn't stick too far out of the middle of the tool.  It took me about an hour to figure out how to do that without doing anything else.

Outdoors,"While this is a very nice product, I have to say that it has exceeded expectations.  The quality of the wood itself is outstanding.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was due to the fact that there are so many different types of holes in the bottom for each type of hole you drill.  These holes can be tricky to open and close without opening or closing them up.  For instance, if you don't want to use your hands at all to get through these holes, you might as well just put one hand on the other side (for example).<br /><br />I would not recommend this product unless you're willing to spend an additional $20-$30 before you buy something else.",NON-GUIDED

The only thing I would say is that if you are looking for something with lots of storage space (for example 1/4&#34; cabinets), be careful not to over tighten the screws when using your tools.  This will allow him to keep things from sliding around too easily.

The only thing that bothers me about this is the wireless charging cord.<br /><br />If you are looking for an inexpensive way to charge your TV with a cell phone (or something like that), here's my advice:<br /><br />1) You will need to buy one of these chargers before you can use them in any other location.  If you don't want to spend anywhere near $20-30 bucks on anything else, do yourself a favor and buy some new ones.<br /><br />2) Make sure you know how much you pay for each cable box you own.

It took about an hour or so to get used to it.  After 2 weeks you can't really tell when your hair is actually starting to shrink without being too much--it's kind of hard to figure out just how long it will last.  My hair has already started to come back to normal (about 5-10 weeks).<br /><br />I am still trying to figure out how to use this on my balding head.

I have been using it for about a month now and no issues whatsoever.<br /><br />It is easy to set up and operate without having to go through any troubleshooting steps.  The only complaint I have is that you need to unplug the power source in order to turn on the unit.  You can do this by turning off the power supply, which may not be necessary if you are running Windows 7 or later.  If you don't want to use the power cord plugged into an external hard drive (or something like that), then there is nothing to worry about as long as your PC does not interfere with the operation of the Hard Drive.<br /><br />The USB 3.0 port also has support for plugging directly into the computer.

Video Games,"I bought this game for my 3 year old son.  It has a lot of replay value, but it is also very fun to play with your friends.<br /><br />The graphics are good and the story is well written.  I like how you can tell people about their childhood experiences when they were in high school or early teens.  The characters are nice and interesting.  You will be able to choose from many different types of enemies (fantasies, soldiers, etc.).<br /><br />My only complaint is that some of the dialogue isn't quite what you would expect from an adult video game.  Some of the dialogue doesn't quite come across as much as you would expect from an adult video game.",NON-GUIDED
Video Games,"I bought this game for my son.  He loves it, but I do not like the idea of having to go through a lot of hoops and trying to figure out how to play video games.<br /><br />There are so many different ways that you can customize your gameplay from what you see on the screen.  This is one of those games where you have to decide if you want to spend more money or invest in something else.  That's why I decided to give this game a five star rating instead of an 8!<br /><br />The graphics are very good, though there aren't really any graphical glitches at all.  There are some minor typos (e.g. ""froggy"" sounds).  However, most of the time they come across as being pretty darn near-impressive.",NON-GUIDED
Video Games,"I recommend this game to anyone who is new to fighting games.  I have been playing it for over a year now, and the graphics are amazing.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) The gameplay is pretty straight forward/horrific; 2) There's tons of replay value that you can't find in other video games (such as Mass Effect 3 or Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 4)<br />3) You play as a character from an ancient city called Pandaria whose entire civilization was wiped out by humans after hundreds of thousands of years.",NON-GUIDED

It has worked very well with my hair without any problems or side effects.

That being said, as far as sizing goes, you can't really tell by looking at their foot length or feet.  They're about 5'8&#34; long and 6'9&#34; wide.

It's not too big to put on baby clothes, but I don't think we'll ever need that.<br /><br />I'm 5'3&#34; and weigh 205 pounds so no worries about shedding!<br /><br />This is the size of a 9&#34; &#34;x 7&#34; x 11&#34; diaper bag with all the extra room you can get in there if your child doesn't want to lay down at the end of the diaper bag.  We're able to fit our 2 1/2&#34; diapers into one small space without having to worry about falling over or getting caught trying to pull them apart by tugging against each other.  The straps are easy to use (the zipper closes easily) and hold up very well even though they aren't quite as secure as some others out there.",NON-GUIDED

I use it to take pictures with my iPad, iPhone and iPod touch.<br /><br />My biggest gripe about this item is that the &#34;case&#34; on the bottom of the case does not hold up well when you are trying to place your phone or tablet in front of it.  This would be nice if there was some sort of “case closure” around the inside of the case which makes it difficult for me to get rid of those issues.  However, at least one person has reported having trouble getting rid of these cases after using them several times already.  The only complaint I have is that they do not allow hands free movement from the top part of the case to the backside (which can be remedied by putting an end to the strap).  So far so good.",NON-GUIDED

Home Improvement,"After a few months of use, I decided to take a chance and purchase this product.  It's the perfect size for my living room.<br /><br />I'm 5'3&#34; and weigh 185 pounds so it fits me perfectly without being too big or too small.  The only thing I didn't like was how easy it would be to remove the screws on the sides that are just below the top of the unit.  There is no way you can remove the screws if you don't want them removed.  If you do have any problems removing your screws, please contact Customer Care at 1-866-TAKE-THOUGHT<br /><br />You will need an internet browser to view this video.

Home Improvement,"After a few months of use I decided to give this one a try.  It is very easy to set up and operate without any issues.<br /><br />I have been using it for about 3 years now, so the first thing I noticed was that when you turn on/off your furnace (which does not work at all), there is an audible ""Hi"" sound which can be heard by many people around the house.  This is due to the fact that most home repair shops are located in areas with lots of garage doors open during the winter season.  The only reason I don't recommend this product is because it will cause some sort of electrical issue or other problems as well.  However, if you're looking for a way to get more energy out of your home's heating system, this might be the best option.

There is no way to turn on/off the light when there is too much sun.<br />- Will probably order another one if necessary.<br />- Has LED lights that can be turned on or off depending on your mood.<br />- Don't have any extra batteries at all!

They are versatile and easy to set up.<br /><br />I do not think they will last as long as some of the other guitars that were released in the '60's or '70's would perform well without them being too expensive.

It is easy to install, but I do not have a lot of room in the car so we had to buy something else.<br /><br />The only thing i don't like about it is that there is no way to turn off the power when you are driving at full speed without having to change the batteries every 30 seconds or so. You can adjust the speed manually by turning on/off the button (which isn't recommended).<br /><br />It also does not take up much space compared to other auto alarm systems out there. This one takes up less space than any other auto alarm system out there. If you want to keep an eye on your vehicle while driving, then this may be the best option.",NON-GUIDED

If you wear an outside shoe (e.g. tennis shoes) then your feet will tend to sag quite a bit due to the fact that some of the rubberized soles just don't hold up well enough.

It was written by Dr. David Gorshkov (the author of The Psychedelic Dreamscape).  He believes that there is no such thing as ""ancient knowledge"".

Lawn and Garden,"What a Wonderful Life!<br /><br />I was so excited when I saw this book.  It is one of the best books I have ever read.<br /><br />The author has taken it upon himself to write &#34;Love&#34; about life in New York City, as well as many other parts of the city.  How can you possibly expect anything different from this man?  We are living in an era where we live in constant fear of losing our money or getting sucked into debt due to lack of access to affordable housing.  This book offers insight into the lives of millions of people around the world who depend on us for basic needs such as water, electricity, clothing, shelter, etc.  What makes me want to give this book a try is how much I am willing to invest in something that will change my life every day.

We have a lot of room in there so we don't have to worry about anything falling apart.  She has been using it on her bed since she was 10 months old (she really doesn't want to fall asleep).  The only thing I would say is that if you are looking for baby toys, these will be great!<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Easy to use.<br />- Looks just like any other toy out there.

Camera,"I bought this camera for my wife and she loves it.  It is very easy to set up, has a lot of features that you can easily do without having to go through the whole setup process.  The main thing I like about this camera is its ability to take pictures with your phone or tablet while still being in use.  There are many functions available which allow you to make adjustments when needed.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars was due to the lack of battery life.  If you have an older model then this will not be the case.  You just need to turn off the power button after each charge but if you don't want to wait long enough to get used to what's on the other end of the screen (i.e. shutter speed).",NON-GUIDED

The fabric seems to hold up quite well even though my feet have started to move more than once over the last several days.  This one has held up pretty well without any issues whatsoever.<br /><br />The colors are bright and vibrant which isn't something you'd expect from a &#34;real&#34; outfit.

There were no instructions on how to program or what not to do.  They said they could only program at least 3 different languages (English, French, German, Spanish, Japanese).

You can choose from four different choices:<br /><br />(1) Your character must be an American citizen who has been in the U.S. for at least 50 years (or more) of his/her country's military service before he becomes eligible for entry into the U.S. Military.<br /><br />(2) The United States Armed Forces cannot enter the war zone unless both parties agree to take part in joint operations against North Korea.",NON-GUIDED

There are also some mini-games where you can play as well as co-op or soloing.  That said, if you want to get into fighting games like Call of Duty: World at War II, don't hesitate to try these!<br /><br />The controls themselves aren't what most people would normally expect from a video game.

My husband has always been able to get rid of his greasy skin without resorting to chemical castor oil as we all know him.<br /><br />The only thing I would say about this product is that it does not deter you from using it if you are going to do anything else with it.  You may want to take care of some other types of hair (i.e., tanning bedding).  However, taking care of any type of hair will definitely help!

Video Games,"First released on PC in 2000.  The first two games were based on Call of Duty: Ghosts, the second was based on Call of Duty: Black Ops II, and the third was based on Call of Duty: Black Ops III.  I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how this game is going to work as well as other video games.<br /><br />I have been playing both Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare (BTS) and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare for about 3 years now.  Both are pretty good at simulating real-world events that took place around the world during World War II.  However, it's not realistic enough to actually see what happens when you try to build your own city from scratch.  You can't really go wrong with BTS until you've played them before or after they're finished.",NON-GUIDED

It has tons of replay value and I've never been disappointed in anything like this one.  The graphics are very good as compared to other AAA titles on the market.  You'll be hard pressed to find something better than this without having spent thousands of dollars or hours trying to figure out how to do it yourself.

You will not be able to play any of these discs without having access to an internet connection.  The only thing I didn't like was how easy it would be to figure out how to hook up wireless Internet (WiFi) to your TV via bluetooth.  That said, if you want to watch movies or other video at once, just plug into one of the cable box's ""Home Entertainment Providers.""<br /><br />I don't think anyone who wants to use their televisions as much as I do may want to get involved with some kind of network security program called FIOS.",NON-GUIDED

You have to remove all the paper towels from the dryer (which was an issue with mine).

Home Improvement,"My husband and I bought this for our 3 year old son.  He loves it!<br /><br />It is very easy to set up.<br /><br />We have a lot of furniture in the house, so we wanted something that he could use as a home improvement tool.  We had already purchased several different types of tools from Home Improvement back in the '90s (and they were all pretty expensive).  The first one was an 8 inch drill bit.  It's not much bigger than what you would find at any hardware store or garage sale.  But there are plenty of small pieces that can be put together without being too big.  You will need some basic tools like pliers, screws, saws, screwdrivers, etc.  There are also lots of smaller pieces that don't require much more than your typical drill bit.",NON-GUIDED
